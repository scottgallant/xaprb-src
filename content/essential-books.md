This page lists the most valuable books on my bookshelf. In my opinion, these books contain knowledge or wisdom that is so valuable and so hard to find that they're worth far more than the cover price. I read a lot of books; [I post independent, unbiased, non-paid-for reviews of selected books](/blog/category/review/) on this blog; and I mention the best of the best here on this page. If you're interested in sending me a review copy of a book, please feel free to contact me.

### [High Performance MySQL](http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-MySQL-Optimization-Replication/dp/1449314287?tag=xaprb-20)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-MySQL-Optimization-Replication/dp/1449314287?tag=xaprb-20"><img src="/media/2010/01/high_performance_mysql.jpg" alt="High Performance MySQL" title="High Performance MySQL" width="122" height="160" class="size-full wp-image-1558" /></a>

I'm the lead author of this book. It is the must-have book for anyone who goes beyond casual use of MySQL. There's no other book like it. Call me biased if you wish!

### [Web Operations](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Operations-Keeping-Data-Time/dp/1449377440?tag=xaprb-20)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Web-Operations-Keeping-Data-Time/dp/1449377440?tag=xaprb-20"><img src="/media/2010/07/web_operations.gif" alt="Web Operations" title="Web Operations" class="size-full wp-image-1864" /></a>

I'm a contributing author to this book. It's a groundbreaking look at an emerging discipline, and explains how leading practitioners think and act to keep systems up and people happy. I reviewed it [here](/blog/2010/07/03/a-review-of-web-operations-by-john-allspaw-and-jesse-robbins/).

### [The Ultimate Guide to Building Database-Driven Apps with Go](https://vividcortex.com/resources/building-database-driven-apps-with-go/)

src='/media/2015/01/ultimate-guide.png' alt='The Ultimate Guide to Building Database-Driven Apps with Go' width="135" height="150" /></a>

This is a free e-book that requires registration with VividCortex. I wrote this book after years of experience with Go's
`database/sql` interface. I also was one of the main authors for <a
href="http://go-database-sql.org">go-database-sql.org</a>, which taught me a lot
about the subject matter. This is a complete rewrite from scratch, however.

### [Optimizing Oracle Performance](http://www.amazon.com/Optimizing-Oracle-Performance-Cary-Millsap/dp/059600527X?tag=xaprb-20)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Optimizing-Oracle-Performance-Cary-Millsap/dp/059600527X?tag=xaprb-20"><img src="/media/2009/11/optimizing_oracle_performance-150x150.jpg" alt="Optimizing Oracle Performance" title="Optimizing Oracle Performance" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1416" /></a>

This is an essential book for anyone interested in performance of *any* system, not just Oracle. I [reviewed it here](/blog/2009/11/07/a-review-of-optimizing-oracle-performance-by-cary-millsap/).

### [Relational Database Design and the Optimizers](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0471719994/?tag=xaprb-20)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0471719994/?tag=xaprb-20"><img src="/media/2010/01/relational-index-design-optimizers-small.jpg" alt="Relational Database Index Design and the Optimizers" title="Relational Database Index Design and the Optimizers" width="150" height="239" class="size-full wp-image-2025" /></a>

The focus is on a scientific method to design indexes that will produce the best performance for queries. It goes into quite a bit of detail on how databases execute specific types of queries, and develops a generic cost model that can be used to produce a quick upper-bound estimate (QUBE) for the execution time of a query. The book focuses on DB2, Oracle, and SQL Server, but applies equally well to MySQL and PostgreSQL. Generally, the book concludes, we should use indexes much more than we often do, and we should not hold irrational fears about the cost of maintaining indexes. I [reviewed it here](/blog/2010/09/19/a-review-of-relational-database-design-and-the-optimizers-by-lahdenmaki-and-leach/).

### [Understanding MySQL Internals](http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-MySQL-Internals-Sasha-Pachev/dp/0596009577?tag=xaprb-20)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-MySQL-Internals-Sasha-Pachev/dp/0596009577?tag=xaprb-20"><img src="/media/2010/02/understanding-mysql-internals-150x150.gif" alt="Understanding MySQL Internals" title="Understanding MySQL Internals" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1629" /></a>

This book complements [High Performance MySQL](http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-MySQL-Optimization-Replication/dp/0596101716?tag=xaprb-20) extremely well. I believe it should be mandatory reading for MySQL DBAs and developers once they have a working knowledge of how to use the server. I [reviewed it here](/blog/2010/02/19/a-review-of-understanding-mysql-internals-by-sasha-pachev/).

### [The Art of Capacity Planning](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Capacity-Planning-Scaling-Resources/dp/0596518579/?tag=xaprb-20)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Capacity-Planning-Scaling-Resources/dp/0596518579/?tag=xaprb-20"><img src="/media/2009/10/Art-Capacity-Planning-150x150.gif" alt="The Art of Capacity Planning" title="The Art of Capacity Planning" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1376" /></a>

This is a clear and simple book on how to measure and plan for capacity. Highly recommended. I [reviewed it here](/blog/2009/10/24/a-review-of-the-art-of-capacity-planning-by-john-allspaw/).

### [Beginning Database Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597699/?tag=xaprb-20)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597699/?tag=xaprb-20"><img src="/media/2009/08/beginning_database_design-125x150.gif" alt="Beginning Database Design: From Novice to Professional" title="Beginning Database Design: From Novice to Professional" width="125" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1235" /></a>

A well-written introduction to database design. I [reviewed it here](/blog/2009/08/22/a-review-of-beginning-database-design-by-clare-churcher/).<br style="clear: both" />

### [SQL Antipatterns](http://www.amazon.com/SQL-Antipatterns-Programming-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356557?tag=xaprb-20)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/SQL-Antipatterns-Programming-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356557?tag=xaprb-20"><img src="/media/2011/06/bksqla_xlargecover.jpg" alt="" title="SQL Antipatterns" width="190" height="228" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2372" /></a>

An excellent book for developers who must interact with databases. It explains the mistakes that programmers make over and over again, showing why they're bad approaches, when to use them anyway, and what good alternatives exist. I reviewed it [here](/blog/2011/06/11/a-review-of-sql-antipatterns-by-bill-karwin/).<br style="clear: both" />

### [Scalable Internet Architectures](http://www.amazon.com/dp/067232699X?tag=xaprb-20)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/067232699X?tag=xaprb-20"><img src="/media/2009/02/scalable_internet_architectures-150x150.jpg" alt="Scalable Internet Architectures" title="Scalable Internet Architectures" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-868" /></a>

A great all-around book about building scalable systems. I [reviewed it here](/blog/2009/02/21/review-of-scalable-internet-architectures-by-theo-schlossnagle/).

### [SQL and Relational Theory](http://www.amazon.com/SQL-Relational-Theory-Write-Accurate/dp/0596523068?tag=xaprb-20)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/SQL-Relational-Theory-Write-Accurate/dp/0596523068?tag=xaprb-20"><img src="/media/2010/01/sql_and_relational_theory-150x150.gif" alt="SQL and Relational Theory" title="SQL and Relational Theory" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1563" /></a>

C. J. Date's most important book on relational theory is much improved over its predecessor, and is well worth reading deeply to gain both the formal and the intuitive understanding needed to write correct SQL. I didn't like it at first, but really changed my mind about it later. I [reviewed it here](/blog/2009/03/29/a-review-of-sql-and-relational-theory-by-c-j-date/).

### [Higher Order Perl](http://www.amazon.com/Higher-Order-Perl-Transforming-Programs/dp/1558607013?tag=xaprb-20)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Higher-Order-Perl-Transforming-Programs/dp/1558607013?tag=xaprb-20"><img src="/media/2010/01/higher_order_perl-150x150.jpg" alt="Higher Order Perl" title="Higher Order Perl" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1565" /></a>

This book changed my whole approach to programming. It was as revolutionary for me as the day that I truly understood what a variable is. I am not sure you'll get much out of it if you don't know Perl, but it might be worth learning Perl just to be able to appreciate the paradigm shift you can learn from this book.

### [Cloud Application Architectures](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596156367?tag=xaprb-20)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596156367?tag=xaprb-20"><img src="/media/2010/01/cloud_application_architectures.gif" alt="Cloud Application Architectures" title="Cloud Application Architectures" width="122" height="160" class="size-full wp-image-1943" /></a>

A great book on this topic. Short --- 150 pages --- but very deep, and highly readable. Mostly about the Amazon platform. The author really knows first-hand how to build apps and businesses in the cloud! [I reviewed it here](/blog/2010/07/04/a-review-of-cloud-application-architectures-by-george-reese/).

### [MySQL 5.1 Plugin Development](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1849510601/?tag=xaprb-20)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1849510601/?tag=xaprb-20"><img src="/media/2010/01/mysql-plugin-development.jpg" alt="MySQL 5.1 Plugin Development" title="MySQL 5.1 Plugin Development" width="125" height="152" class="size-full wp-image-2062" /></a>

A very useful book for anyone who wants to modify the MySQL source code. Also excellent for just understanding the code better. [I reviewed it here](/blog/2010/10/10/a-review-of-mysql-5-1-plugin-development-by-golubchik-and-hutchings/).
