[O'Reilly Velocity](http://velocityconf.com) is November 17-19 in Barcelona. O’Reilly gave me a 2-day pass to give away, and I decided to have some fun with it. We’re also giving away a pass on the [VividCortex blog](https://vividcortex.com/blog/2014/10/30/win-a-free-pass-to-velocity-barcelona/), so you can double your odds of winning.

For your chance to win a 2-day pass, do one of the following:

* Answer any of the following questions; or
* Write a haiku that’s somehow relevant to Velocity

Tweet your answers to @xaprb with #velocitytrivia. You can find the answers to the questions on the [velocityconf.com](http://velocityconf.com) website. Speed and accuracy is your friend in this game, as answers will not be accepted after November 6. I’ll announce the winner November 7. Good luck!
 
Here are the questions:

Q.1: Which sessions are about anomaly detection? Make sure you look for one that doesn’t have “anomaly” in the title.

Q.2: Which session (link to it) might help you avoid cognitive traps?
 
Q.3: Which session (link to it) is absolutely swimming in puns?
 
Q.4:What are the “five reasons” to come to Velocity? Bolded reasons are fine. (hint, reading About Velocity will help)
 
Q.5: Which Velocity EU Event gives you 5 minutes to get on stage and talk your latest passion, idea or hack?
 
Q.6: Who’s going to get up on stage and use math and physics to tune a musical instrument, and what does that have to do with web performance and operations?
