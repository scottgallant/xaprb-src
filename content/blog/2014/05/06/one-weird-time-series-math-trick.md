Monitorama 2014 Portland has been a great show. I've enjoyed the technical
nature of the talks, the diversity of the speakers, the topics from hilarious to
thought-provoking, and the stage in a theater, set up for a Shakespearean
tragedy.

I have also taken a lot of notes. For example, Toufic from Metafor Software
suggested that the audience look into the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. I am proud of
the slide that made its way into my talk as a result:

My slides are embedded below. Enjoy. I've also uploaded an [Excel spreadsheet](/media/2014/05/time-series-tricks.xlsx) you
can use to tinker with the math and reproduce my results. Let me know if I did
anything wrong, please!
