Do you use Google's Go language (golang)? Do you use a relational database such as MySQL
or PostgreSQL with it? Do you want to learn how to?

Go has a package called `database/sql` for connecting to relational databases.
There's package [documentation](http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/), but you'll
need to read the source code if you really want to understand how to use the
package. The documentation doesn't really explain how to use the package, it
just explains what it does.

Fortunately, there's a free, online, opensource tutorial that fills this need.
If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it. (I am one of the authors.) There
is a lot of wisdom from very experienced people in the tutorial, including the
two primary authors of the main MySQL driver for Go.

The tutorial is online at [go-database-sql.org](http://go-database-sql.org/).

Tell your friends, please! Friends don't let friends make preventable mistakes
