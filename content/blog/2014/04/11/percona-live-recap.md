I had a great time at Percona Live. I think this was the best MySQL
conference I've ever been to.  (The food was excellent too. The fastest way to a
man's heart is through his stomach.)

The talks I attended were very good. Jay Janssen's tutorial on Percona XtraDB
Cluster was impressive. I can't imagine how much time he must have spent
preparing for that.

I was very happy that Oracle, MariaDB, and WebScaleSQL had a strong presence,
too. There were also a lot of one-degree-of-separation talks on topics like
Hadoop and so forth. I attended a talk by Google on how their F1 database works.
The biggest surprise in that talk? F1 is more expensive for them to operate than
MySQL. I expected that anything they built in-house would surely be more cost
effective, but I was wrong.

The community awards and lightning talks were fun as always. My co-founder Kyle
Redinger was scheduled to do a non-technical lightning talk about how to squat
properly. (He's a hardcore CrossFitter, gym owner, and coach.) He ended up
having a conflict, so Tim Chadwick from Dyn took over, and I played Vanna White.
And I mean *white*, as in White Gym Socks Clearly Visible On Skinny Legs. What
good is a lightning talk if you don't look goofy?

The expo hall was great for us (VividCortex). I was so busy at the booth
that I didn't spend a lot of time visiting other booths. We certainly got 
our money's worth from having this booth, and have already decided to commit
early for next year's event.

Speaking of VividCortex, you may know that we launched our product during the
conference. The actual launch was at DEMO Enterprise, a launch event, but the
two events overlapped somewhat. Now that we've launched, our closed beta is
ended, and you can sign up for a free trial at [https://vividcortex.com](https://vividcortex.com).

It was great to see so many old friends at the conference. I wish I'd been able
to spend more time with more people, as I always wish every single year. 
Many of the old traditions carry on; and we create new ones. Next year, join me
and Kyle for a Tech WOD (workout of the day) at a local Crossfit. It's a great
way to start the day off right at 6:30am after a late night of drinking!
