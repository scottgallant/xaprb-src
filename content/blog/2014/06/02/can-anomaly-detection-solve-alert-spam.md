Anomaly detection is all the buzz these days in the "#monitoringlove" community.

![anomaly][anomaly] 

The conversation usually goes something like the following:

* Alerts are spammy and often generate false positives.
* What you really want to know is when something anomalous is happening.
* Anomaly detection can replace static thresholds and heuristics.
* The result will be better accuracy and lower noise.

I'm going to give a [webinar about the science of statistical anomaly detection on June 17th][webinar]. Sorry, no spoilers will be given here. You'll have to attend the webinar to find out what I think on the above topics.
