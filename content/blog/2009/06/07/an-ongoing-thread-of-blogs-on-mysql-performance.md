In the last six months, things have gotten much busier in the world of MySQL performance. That is, making MySQL and InnoDB scale faster out of the box. This is a great trend and I hope it keeps going. At this point I'm fighting to find enough time to read about what people are doing; I can't keep up fast enough to actually understand the improvements. That's also good.

The blogs that are posting the most news and analysis are [MySQL Performance Blog](http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/), [Mikael Ronstrom's blog](http://mikaelronstrom.blogspot.com/), [DimitriK's blog](http://dimitrik.free.fr/blog/), and [Mark Callaghan's blog](http://mysqlha.blogspot.com/).
