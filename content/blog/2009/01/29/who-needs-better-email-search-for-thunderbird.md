Thunderbird's email search isn't that great by today's standards. If I type "red dog" into the search bar it doesn't even tokenize and search for the words separately -- it's a substring match so "my dog is red" isn't found. And it's slow.

What about embedding "real" fulltext search into it? Sphinx perhaps?

Just a thought.
