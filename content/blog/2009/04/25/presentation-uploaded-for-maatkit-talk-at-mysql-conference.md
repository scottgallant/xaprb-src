The slides for [my session on Maatkit at the MySQL Conference](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2009/public/schedule/detail/5677) are uploaded. They should appear on the [speaker presentation files page](http://www.mysqlconf.com/mysql2009/public/schedule/proceedings), but I have heard that it can take a few days. Please let me know if they're not there by May 1, 2009.

I did not have time to plow through everything in the slides. (I deliberately prepared more material than I could cover, and just stopped when I ran out of time.) Alas, I did not remember to take my voice recorder that day, so I have no audio to share with you!
