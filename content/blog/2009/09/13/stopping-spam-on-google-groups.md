Spammers seem to have gotten smarter recently, and able to post garbage to Google Groups. There was some spam on a couple of the groups I've created, and members helped me find a way to stop it. I'm glad they did, because since then it's stopped an increasing flow of spam. I just deleted and banned a whole bunch of emails titled "answer group" across different groups, and I see the same crud got through to a group I'm on but don't own.

Here's the recipe:

*   Moderate messages from new members.

That's all. Then you can log in and delete emails from spammers, and ban them, so that at least only you, and not the whole group, gets spammed.
