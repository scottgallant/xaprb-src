A lot of times I'm looking at several time-series samples of numbers embedded in free-form text, and I want to know how the numbers change over time. For example, two samples of SHOW INNODB STATUS piped through `grep wait` might contain the following:

<pre>Mutex spin waits 0, rounds 143359179688, OS waits 634106844
RW-shared spins 1224152309, OS waits 38278807; RW-excl spins 2432166425, OS waits 35264871
Mutex spin waits 0, rounds 143386303439, OS waits 634292093
RW-shared spins 1224197048, OS waits 38281423; RW-excl spins 2432347936, OS waits 35271423</pre>

How much have the numbers changed in the second sample? My head is too lazy to do that math. So Daniel Nichter and I whipped up Yet Another Snippet to self-discover patterns of text and numbers, and compare each line against the previous line that matches the same pattern. Let's fetch it:

<pre>wget <a href="http://maatkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/util/rel">http://maatkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/util/rel</a></pre>

Now give it the above input, and it'll print out something useful (emphasis mine):

<pre>Mutex spin waits 0, rounds 143359179688, OS waits 634106844
RW-shared spins 1224152309, OS waits 38278807; RW-excl spins 2432166425, OS waits 35264871
Mutex spin waits 0, rounds <strong>27123751</strong>, OS waits <strong>185249</strong>
RW-shared spins <strong>44739</strong>, OS waits <strong>2616</strong>; RW-excl spins <strong>181511</strong>, OS waits <strong>6552</strong></pre>

My lazy brain likes that much better.
