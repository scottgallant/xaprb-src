After a long time working mostly on [Maatkit](http://www.maatkit.org/) and neglecting [innotop](http://code.google.com/p/innotop), Aaron Racine has stepped forward to take over the development. I moved it off Sourceforge (for the same reasons I moved Maatkit) and onto Google Code. Aaron has set up mailing lists and so on, and there is a discussion about which features to add and change. Your input is welcomed on the mailing lists!
