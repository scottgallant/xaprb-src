Our [Percona Performance Conference](http://conferences.percona.com/) is [making the rounds on Digg](http://digg.com/linux_unix/Percona_Performance_Conference_2009_on_April_22_23). Is it bad form to ask for people to vote for it? .... ok then I won't.

But I assume it's okay for me to suggest that perconaperfconf09 is a reasonable tag to use for this event.
