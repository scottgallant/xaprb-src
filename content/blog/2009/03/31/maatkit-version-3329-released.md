[Maatkit](http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/) version 3329 has been released, as per our usual monthly release cycle.

Significant changes in this version include some bug fixes to mk-duplicate-key-checker, and a lot of new features in mk-query-digest. We made some changes to mk-table-checksum and mk-table-sync. We also updated shared code in all tools.

Interesting and significant things to mention this month:

*   Thanks to a corporation who sponsored development on certain tools (I haven't gotten permission to mention their name.)
*   The efforts to be more inclusive and participatory (e.g. more truly open-source) have really paid off, and personally I find it very gratifying to see the discussions on the mailing list. And new project members have contributed code and very useful advice! Thanks, and hooray!
*   The project wiki is reorganized and much better to use now.
