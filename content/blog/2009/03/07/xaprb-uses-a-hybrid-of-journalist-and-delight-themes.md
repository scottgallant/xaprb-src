A while ago I switched my theme to Journalist (link at the very bottom of the page) because I thought it was well laid out and solidly designed -- I mean it uses sensible CSS and XHTML etc. The only thing I didn't care for was that it was a little too minimal, if anything. There are lots of themes out there that look gorgeous, but when I tested them they don't render right.

So I have made a hybrid. Just a few edits to CSS and borrowing a few images from the [deLight](http://webdemar.com/wordpress/wordpress-theme-delight-1-2/) theme later, and now I have something that pleases me visually too.

And in the process I wouldn't be surprised if I've broken something for Windows IE users or what have you. But I'm sure someone will let me know.

For future reference, I'm attaching an image of what it looks like.
