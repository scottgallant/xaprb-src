If you've been holding out for that golden opportunity, now's a great time to get involved in [Maatkit](http://www.maatkit.org/).

Until now I haven't really made a conscious effort to open-source the decision process and get people involved; Maatkit has been largely driven by so-called "real-world needs," as perceived through my little lens on the world (and emails from the whole Percona team telling me when something's wrong). I guess I am *likely* to remain some kind of benevolent dictator, because I created Maatkit and historically I'm the main hacker. **But it doesn't have to stay that way, and the project and users will be better off if it doesn't**.

So I've been trying to break out of the rut of just having some little email exchange with people using the tools, and bring things onto [the Maatkit mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/maatkit-discuss) for discussion and voting. Two mailing lists I'm lurking on (Drizzle and PostgreSQL hackers) have inspired me to do this. And the person who jumped into [innotop](http://code.google.com/p/innotop/) maintenance set up a whole slew of mailing lists right away, which was also educational for me -- it really is beneficial.

Right now if you jump on the mailing list, you can vote on topics such as breaking backwards compatibility with command-line options for the purpose of consistent and easy-to-learn options for the future.

And I have honestly gotten intolerant about the volume of email I deal with, so when someone emails me personally I usually tell them bluntly to take it to the list, so others can learn and contribute, instead of making me the single point of contention in the knowledge-sharing system, and denying others the opportunity to learn.

So -- my point is, go participate, and [let's make Maatkit more Open Source, not just Free Software](/blog/2008/05/14/mysql-free-software-but-not-open-source/).
