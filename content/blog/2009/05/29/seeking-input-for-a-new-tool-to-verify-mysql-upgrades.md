I've had several customers in the last week or so who need a way to verify that their application will work well after an upgrade. I'm seeking input on [a new tool to help with MySQL upgrades](http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/issues/detail?id=422). Please add comments, either here or on the [bug report](http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/issues/detail?id=422), or on [the mailing list topic](http://groups.google.com/group/maatkit-discuss/browse_thread/thread/49f4564111c78a2f).

If someone wants to sponsor this work, that would also be welcomed.
