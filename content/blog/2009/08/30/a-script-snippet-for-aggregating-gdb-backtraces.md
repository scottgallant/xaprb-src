**Note: the bt-aggregate tool has been deprecated and replaced by the [pmp](http://aspersa.googlecode.com/svn/html/pmp.html) tool, which can do all that and more.**

A short time ago in a galaxy nearby, [Domas Mituzas wrote about contention profiling with GDB stack traces](http://mituzas.lt/2009/02/15/poor-mans-contention-profiling/). Mark Callaghan found the technique useful, and contributed an awk script (in the comments) to aggregate stack traces and identify which things are blocking most threads. I've used it myself a time or five. But I've found myself wanting it to be fancier, for various reasons. So I wrote [a little utility that can aggregate and pretty-print backtraces](http://aspersa.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pmp). It can handle unresolved symbols, and aggregate by only the first N lines of the stack trace. Here's an example of a mysqld instance that's really, really frozen up:

<pre>bt-aggregate -4 samples/backtrace.txt | head -n12
2396 threads with the following stack trace:
