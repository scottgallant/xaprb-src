Yesterday I attended [CPOSC 2009](http://www.cposc.org/). The conference was great. It was very well run, and I liked the sessions. I would definitely attend this conference again, and will recommend that Percona sponsor it next year. I attended the following talks:

*   Stop Worrying and Start Monitoring with Nagios (Andrew Libby)
*   DRBD, Network Raid, High Availability and General Awesomeness (Brian Gorka)
*   MySQL Performance Tuning for non-DBAs (Tom Clark)
*   Wonderful Desktop Tricks, and Aesthetics (Seth Jerome)
*   Jump Start Django: The Web Framework for Perfectionists with Deadlines (Rob Yates)
*   Watching and Manipulating Your Network Traffic (Josiah Ritchie)

And then of course I gave my own talk on [Maatkit](http://www.maatkit.org/) ([slides](/media/2009/10/Maatkit_CPOSC.pdf)). I didn't follow the slides. I took a quick poll of who was interested in learning about making an open-source project that can support a full-time employee, and nobody was, so I skipped that and talked about what the tools can do.

In meta-news, it seemed that a lot of people already knew about Maatkit, and Percona's name and open-source software (high-performance versions of the MySQL database server, XtraDB storage engine) seemed pretty well known too. Someone asked if Percona can support a MySQL Cluster project that has stalled with another vendor, and I was happy to say we can. Several people complimented Percona's training, which is really a compliment to Morgan Tocker.
