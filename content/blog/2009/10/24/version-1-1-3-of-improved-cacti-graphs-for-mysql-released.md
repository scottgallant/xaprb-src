I've just released version 1.1.3 of the [Cacti templates I wrote for MySQL](http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/). This is a bug-fix release only, and affects only ss\_get\_mysql\_stats.php. To upgrade from the previous release, upgrade ss\_get\_mysql\_stats.php. Don't forget to save and restore your configuration options, if any. (Note that there is a feature to help with this: you can keep configuration options in ss\_get\_mysql\_stats.php.cnf to avoid making them in ss\_get\_mysql\_stats.php.)

> [VividCortex](https://vividcortex.com/) is the startup I founded in 2012. It's the easiest way to monitor what
> your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers [MySQL performance
> monitoring](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/mysql/) and [PostgreSQL
> performance management](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/postgres/) among many
> other features.

Next up: actual template changes! More graphs!
