Do you know what this is?

<pre>debian:~/mysql-cacti-templates/t# php mysql.php 

not ok 1 - basic test to check that the test suite works
#     Failed test (/root/mysql-cacti-templates/t/mysql.php at line 9)
#     got: Array
(
    [b] => 2
)

# Looks like you failed 1 tests of 1.
`</pre>

It is the beginning of a test suite, which is long overdue. Writing a test suite for [this code](http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/) would have saved a lot of work ages ago. But as I always say, if you don't do it from the beginning, it's much harder to do later. And this code began its life as a script someone else wrote, so I wasn't there at the beginning. Better late than never.
