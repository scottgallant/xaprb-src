I've bought my plane tickets for [OpenSQL Camp US 2009](http://www.opensqlcamp.org/), in Portland, Oregon on the weekend of November 14th. I'm really looking forward to the event and seeing friends again. And I'm psyched that the third incarnation of this event is taking place! I wish I could have been at the 2nd one too, earlier this year in Europe.
