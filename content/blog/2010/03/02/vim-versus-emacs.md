Which is better? I don't know, because I'm a Vim user, so it's a moot point for me. But I have not noticed any Emacs-style keyboard shortcuts on websites. To the contrary, it seems like everything is Vim-style -- certainly most Google apps are Vim-ish, and even Firefox is Vim-ish (press the / key to start searching for text on the page). Based on this highly scientific criterion, I declare Vim the winner.
