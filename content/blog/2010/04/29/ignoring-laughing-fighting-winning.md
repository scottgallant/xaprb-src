A now-famous quote that I probably don't need to attribute: "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."

Where is Drizzle in this lifecycle? I've been hearing and reading some comments to the tune of "those Drizzle guys think it's easy to rip MySQL stuff out and start over, wait till they see how hard it's going to get when the real world sinks in." Maybe, maybe. But maybe not, too. Maybe not.

I've seen more than one software project that was belittled as "never gonna amount to anything, save your time" and went on to do quite well. Never underestimate the power of a handful of passionate and talented people. I personally feel that Drizzle has a bright future.
