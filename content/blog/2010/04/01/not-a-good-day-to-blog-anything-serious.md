Wow. Now's not a good day to announce anything true on your blog. I see a bunch of stuff that probably is true -- but who's banking on that? Is there really a new version of HeidiSQL? Is Arjen really moving to California to do MySQL work? Is Tokutek really purchasing Oracle? Gee, I'm not sure.

If I had any thoughts left in my head, I'd [make a funny](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uwOL4rB-go) myself, but my head's pretty empty. Believe that if you want to.
