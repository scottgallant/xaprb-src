Bug reports can be fun. They can also be terrible. Either way they can be entertaining. On the Drizzle IRC channel today I saw a couple references to MySQL bug reports: [it is stop working](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=56177) and [Does not make toast](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=2) (which reminds me of the [Mozilla bug report about the kitchen sink](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122411)). Got any other favourites<sup>1</sup>?
