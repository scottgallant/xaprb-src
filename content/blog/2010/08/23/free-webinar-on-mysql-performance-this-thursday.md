ODTUG invited me to give a webinar and I said yes, so this Thursday you're invited to join me as I talk about MySQL performance. We've come a very long way towards a MySQL that can perform well on modern hardware, and there really isn't broad recognition of this. A lot of the best work has gone into the InnoDB "plugin" storage engine, which was announced after my co-authors and I sent [High Performance MySQL](http://tinyurl.com/highperfmysql) to the press. I will explain what you should be doing differently now than you did two years ago, and suggest a performance-in-a-nutshell configuration baseline for MySQL that's quite different from what I'd have said in 2008. You can [register for free through GoToWebinar](https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/470088995). See you there.
