Some people seem unclear about whether there will be a 2011 MySQL conference from O'Reilly. [There most definitely will be, and the CfP is open](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/). We are looking for speakers. I'm on the speaker selection committee again this year for the Nth time, and my advice from [past](/blog/2009/12/19/how-to-write-a-good-mysql-conference-proposal/) [years](/blog/2007/10/05/how-to-get-your-session-accepted-to-mysql-conference-2008/) still stands. This year we're also looking for a greater diversity of database products, including other relational databases, NoSQL databases, and ancillary technologies.
