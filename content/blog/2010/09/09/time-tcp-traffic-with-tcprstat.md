I just realized that I didn't publicize this in the Postgres world, or anywhere but the MySQL blogosphere for that matter. Some folks at my company have released a generic TCP-response-time tool. Very useful for monitoring, benchmarks, historical metrics, and so on. It's kind of like iostat, but for TCP traffic, and fully focused on time, not traffic size. Performance == time and tasks, and this is a lightweight way to measure that data. I wrote an introductory blog post [here](http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2010/08/31/introducing-tcprstat-a-tcp-response-time-tool/), and the documentation is [here](http://www.percona.com/docs/wiki/tcprstat:start).
