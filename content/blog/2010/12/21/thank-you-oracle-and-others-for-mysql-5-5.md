I just wanted to express my appreciation for the 5.5 release. I know a lot of great engineers, documentation writers, testers, packagers, product managers, and even non-technical people must have done far more work on this release than we can see externally to Oracle, and many of those people might not be named anywhere. I know who some of you are, but surely not all of you. And, thanks to those who began this effort years ago at MySQL and then at Sun, who may not be involved anymore. Thank you to all of you, whoever you are.
