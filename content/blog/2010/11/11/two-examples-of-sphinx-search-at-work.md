[Sphinx](http://sphinxsearch.com/) is an amazing piece of software. Andrew Aksyonoff is an amazing guy, too. But aside from Andrew's many talents, and Sphinx's awesomeness, I wanted to list two related examples of how Sphinx makes the world a better place. Both examples are implemented as open-source software from [Ivinco](http://www.ivinco.com/), a company founded by a group of people I used to work with.

The first is the Sphinx WordPress search plugin. I have repeatedly considered using it on my own blog, but I'm running on Pair's shared hosting, so I don't think I should do that. But we use it on the MySQL Performance Blog. It returns highly relevant and very fast search results, and has a number of other benefits that end up being very good for SEO, among other things.

The second is the Dokuwiki search plugin. I love Dokuwiki, but its built-in search is horrible; the results are anything but relevant. The Sphinx search plugin is excellent. So if you hate Dokuwiki's search results, try this plugin and see what you think.

Both the WordPress plugin and the Dokuwiki plugin are available from [Ivinco's open-source software page](http://www.ivinco.com/software/).
