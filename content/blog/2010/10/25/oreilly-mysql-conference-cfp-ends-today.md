You have about 14 more hours to [submit session proposals to the O'Reilly MySQL conference](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/public/cfp/126), which is soliciting sessions about all open-source databases: PostgreSQL, CouchDB, Riak, Hadoop, Firebird, you name it. The last-minute proposals are coming fast and furious, as usual, and we have a great selection to choose from, but we need more!
