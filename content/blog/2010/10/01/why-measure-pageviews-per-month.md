I don't get why companies talk about how many pageviews they get per month. Maybe it is a handy metric when thinking about revenue, but when thinking about performance, it's not a convenient way to measure.

For example, "we get 50M page views per month." Let's translate that into something useful for an engineer: 20 page views per second. How about 2.5B pageviews per month? Roughly 1000 per second.

Much easier to think about what this means. And not so impressive.
