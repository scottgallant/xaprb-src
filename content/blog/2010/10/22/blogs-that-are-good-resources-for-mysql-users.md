I keep a file of notes, one per line, for reference. The real reason is for source material if I ever write a 3rd edition of High Performance MySQL, but hardly a day goes by that I don't look something up. At the very top, I have a section that I want to share with you. It's a list of URLs that are invaluable sources of information and insight.

At the very end, I have this note: **All emails from Yasufumi!** Unfortunately that's not a resource I can share with the world.
