I'd like an UNTIL clause, please. I'd use it sort of like LIMIT in MySQL and PostgreSQL, except that it would define when to stop <del datetime="2010-01-23T16:18:53+00:00">returning</del> looking for rows, instead of defining how many to return. Example:

<pre>SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY user_id UNTIL user_id >= 100;</pre>

That would select users up to and including user 99. Ideally the clause could accept any boolean predicate, including subqueries. I'll hold my breath and wait for this wish to come true now.
