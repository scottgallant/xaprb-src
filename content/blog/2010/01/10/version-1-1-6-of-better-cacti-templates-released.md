I've released version 1.1.6 of the [Better Cacti Templates](http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/) project. This release includes a bunch of bug fixes (but not all of them!) and two new sets of graphs. One set is for disk I/O on GNU/Linux, and the other is a new set of templates for OpenVZ. I'm looking for feedback on both of those. This release also has a bunch of code-level features: much better test coverage (hooray!), and a refactored ss\_get\_by_ssh.php that makes it much easier to create new graphs and templates. The SSH-based templates also take advantage of the same caching as the MySQL templates, which makes them a lot more efficient.

> [VividCortex](https://vividcortex.com/) is the startup I founded in 2012. It's the easiest way to monitor what
> your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers [MySQL performance
> monitoring](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/mysql/) and [PostgreSQL
> performance management](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/postgres/) among many
> other features.

There are [upgrade instructions](http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/wiki/UpgradingTemplates) on the project wiki for this and all releases. There is also a comprehensive tutorial on [how to create your own graphs and templates](http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/wiki/CreatingGraphs) with this project. Use the [project issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/issues/list) to view and report issues, and use the [project mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/better-cacti-templates) to discuss the templates and scripts.

The full changelog follows.
