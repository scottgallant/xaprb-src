[Dr. Richard Hipp](http://www.hwaci.com/drh/) gave a talk at [Southeast Linux Fest](http://www.southeastlinuxfest.org/) today on choosing an open-source database. He thinks that NoSQL is not a very good name for the new databases we're seeing these days, so he proposed a new name: postmodern databases. Why postmodern?

*   The absence of objective truth
*   Queries return opinions, not facts

I thought this was the best proposal I've heard for an alternative to the NoSQL moniker. And this is not bashing -- the absence of objective truth can actually be an enabling quality, not necessarily a drawback. There's a lot to compliment about the new databases, and calling them NoSQL is really a disservice -- like calling a car a horseless carriage.
