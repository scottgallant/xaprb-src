The Maatkit toolkit for MySQL has a lot of functionality that's common across the tools. It's not a good idea to document this in each tool's man page, of course. So there is an overall [maatkit man page](http://www.maatkit.org/doc/maatkit.html). It explains concepts such as configuration file syntax. [This and all the other Maatkit man pages are online](http://www.maatkit.org/doc/).
