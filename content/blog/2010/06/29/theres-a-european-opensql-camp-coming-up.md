In addition to the Boston edition, there's an [OpenSQL Camp at the same time and place as FrOSCon](http://opensqlcamp.org/Events/FrOSCon2010/) mid-August in Germany. The call for papers is open until July 11th. As always, the conference is about all kinds of open-source databases: MySQL and PostgreSQL are only two of the obvious ones; MongoDB and Cassandra featured prominently at the last one I attended, and SQLite was well represented at the first one.
