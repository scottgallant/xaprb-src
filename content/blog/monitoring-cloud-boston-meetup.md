I'll be visiting MIT's Tang Center on October 10 in Boston to talk about
monitoring. Join me!

The infrastructure underneath modern apps is rapidly changing, with cloud and
hybrid infrastructure now commonplace. The IaaS trend, however, is just the
beginning. Today, a "cloud-hosted app" may mean renting EC2 instances and
installing and running your platform as you always did, but in the future you
won't think about virtual services. You'll think about services instead, e.g.
DBaaS, lambda computing, and so-called "serverless" computing (c.f. horseless
carriages). This is already the reality; the majority of the growth in database
markets over the last few years has been in services such as Amazon RDS, rather
than installing MySQL in EC2. And most major and emerging database companies are
turning to DBaaS as a major part of their business model (see Azure, MongoDB
Atlas, InfluxCloud, Elastic Cloud, Citus Cloud, etc).

There are some real visibility and governance challenges to solve, though.
Without good visibility, you can't find issues, you can't diagnose and solve
them, and you can't be sure controls and security measures are actually
operational. And "black-box" hosted DBaaS forces you to rely on the monitoring
that the vendor provides, which is often an afterthought at best, designed by
people who aren't solving the same problems you are.

How can you prepare for the challenges of meeting your service level objectives
with services over which you have increasingly less visibility and control? What
benefits will you get in return? And how can you influence the future and ensure
vendors create the solutions you need, rather than accepting what you're given
and making the best of it?

Join me October 10 at the [Boston MySQL Meetup
Group](https://www.meetup.com/mysqlbos/events/233596394/) for a lively
discussion of this topic!

7 p.m. on October 10, 2016
