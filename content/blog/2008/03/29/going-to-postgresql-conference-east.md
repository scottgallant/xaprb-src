I'm heading out to [PostgreSQL Conference East](http://postgresqlconference.org/) in a few hours. Alas, I missed the first day but I'll be there all day tomorrow. I hope to learn, meet people, and generally participate in goodness.

And no, I'm not an expert in PostgreSQL as I am in MySQL, but I have always held it in very high esteem. I am not going to try to spread the MySQL-ness into the PostgreSQL camp :-)

See you there.
