I did an interview with [Barton George from Sun](http://blogs.sun.com/barton808/) while I was at the conference last week. [Barton has now posted the interview](http://blogs.sun.com/barton808/entry/mysql_conf08_talkin_to_baron). If you're quick, you can listen to it before I do.

Topics: everything and anything, including Maatkit and PostgreSQL.
