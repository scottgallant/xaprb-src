My wife wants to learn database design. She is an archaeologist. She wants to read a book written in plain English, not h4x0r jargon. She is smart and capable and knows her own data, but does not know SQL or database theory. She wants to be able to design databases and be understood by others who know database design. She also wants to be able to explain her ideas to a programmer who will build the systems she's designing. Is there a book for her?
