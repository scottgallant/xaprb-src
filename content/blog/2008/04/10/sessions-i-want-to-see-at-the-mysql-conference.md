This year's conference has a great lineup. As usual, with 8 sessions concurrently, it's impossible to pick which ones I want to see. However, I did learn a few things from last year's conference, which I think will help me get more out of it this time.

Number one rule: not all sessions are created equal. I can't say for sure, but I'm pretty sure that when you see "How Product X Will Scale Your Databases" presented by a person from Company X, you can reasonably suspect that Company X is paying for this privilege, and it's not really a session as much as a product demo. These sessions were not reviewed and voted on by the community (I know, because I was one of the community members who were asked to review and vote on proposals. Maybe I'm being a whistle-blower and won't get this honor next year as a result...)

Number two rule: if the description is vague, or if it sounds like regurgitation, I'm skeptical. For example, if the summary starts off by saying "Today's databases are dealing with more data than ever before. Data is mission-critical to today's business enterprises" they lost me already. Writing that in a session description betrays thoughtlessness.

There actually are a couple of time slots that I am not really zinged about any of the sessions, and wish that I could see one of the sessions that's happening while I'm presenting myself instead. But for the most part, there's more goodness than I can actually take in.

This year the conference website has become Web 2.0ish, in a good way. It lets you browse the schedule, and if you're logged in, you can "star" the ones you want to see. Then you get a personal calendar of all the ones you've starred. Not only that, but when you look at a session, it shows you other sessions that other attendees have also starred. Pretty nice, if you're trying to figure out which sessions to see.

Here are the sessions I've starred, in chronological order. It's a little too much work for me to link to them all.

*   All Bases Covered: A Hands-on Introduction to High-availability MySQL and DRBD
*   Memcached and MySQL: Everything You Need To Know
*   New Subquery Optimizations in MySQL 6.0
*   The Lost Art of the Self Join
*   EXPLAIN Demystified
*   High Availability Landscape of MySQL
*   Disaster is Inevitable -- Are You Prepared?
*   Services Oriented Architecture with PHP and MySQL
*   Database Integrity Protection with MySQL and DRBD
*   Falcon from the Beginning
*   Architecture of Maria: A New Storage Engine with a Transactional Design
*   The MySQL Query Cache
*   Grazr: Lessons Learned Building a Web 2.0 Application Using MySQL
*   Extending MySQL
*   Inside the PBXT Storage Engine
*   Helping InnoDB Scale on Servers with Many CPU Cores and Disks
*   Scaling Heavy Concurrent Writes In Real Time
*   High Availability MySQL with DRBD and Heartbeat: MTV Japan Mobile Services

I might change my mind, but these look like a pretty good start.

Rule three: ask around. You can get the scoop, and it might make you change your mind. For example, would you go see the one about the "Lost Art of the Self Join" if I wasn't here telling you how much you don't want to miss that one?

Rule four: go to my sessions \*wink\*
