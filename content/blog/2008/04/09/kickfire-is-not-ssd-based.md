Just a quick note: [Kickfire](http://www.kickfire.com/) is not based on SSD (solid-state device) hard drives. Their old website says "SQL goes solid state" but that just means SQL in hardware, not SSD.

When I was a child, we had a Sears Lady Kenmore clothes washing machine that boasted "solid-state circuits" on the panel, in flowery script writing. It was not based on SSD, either.

Finally, I am not on the Kickfire payroll. I'm not getting anything from working with them, except perhaps the fun of being in their labs while they're still in stealth mode. It's a harder balance than you might think, writing about a product that I don't know about and am excited to learn about, and sounding objective. If I'm sounding like a fanboy, I don't mean to. Trust me, if it's vaporware you'll hear it here first.
