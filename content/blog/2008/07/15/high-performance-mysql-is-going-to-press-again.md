Apparently [High Performance MySQL, 2nd Edition](http://www.highperfmysql.com/) is selling quite well -- I'm not sure exactly how well -- because we're preparing for a second printing. This makes me very happy. I don't think they anticipated going back to the press for quite some time.

The book fluctuates between sales rank 1000 and 2000 on Amazon during the day, and has reached as high as 600 or so. This is just phenomenal. The O'Reilly team was psyched when it broke 5000, and so was I -- but now we've stayed under 2000 for a long time (except when Amazon sold out of it). Frankly I'd have thought that for a niche-market book like this, we'd have been in the 10,000 range or something like that.

Clearly we (the authors, editors, publisher, etc) have done something right! This is a great feeling.

Thanks for sending errata, by the way. I have just completed proofreading the whole book myself, and found a number of things that may be fixed in the second printing. I think certain types of errors won't be fixed, but the important ones certainly will be.
