This release contains bug fixes and new features. It also contains a new tool: [my implementation of Paul Tuckfield's relay log pipelining idea.](/blog/2008/01/13/how-pre-fetching-relay-logs-speeds-up-mysql-replication-slaves/) I have had quite a few responses to that blog post, and requests for the code. So I'm releasing it as part of Maatkit.
