As a proposal reviewer, I looked at and voted on 250+ proposals for sessions and tutorials for this conference. There are going to be some great sessions and tutorials.<sup>[1]</sup>

If you haven't come to the conference previously, it's well worth your time and money, in my opinion.

I (Baron Schwartz) am giving [two sessions](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2008/public/schedule/speaker/142) myself, on extremely practical topics. One is the [query cache](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2008/public/schedule/detail/1763), and the other is [EXPLAIN](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2008/public/schedule/detail/300). Both are the subject of many myths and misunderstandings! My goal is to remove all the programmer-speak and show you how they really work. Once you understand that, you can understand the technical terminology. (But it's very hard to go the other direction).

I haven't decided yet which sessions I want to attend, but I know this: I'm not going to miss seeing how [Beat Vontobel solves a Su Doku puzzle with only self-joins](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2008/public/schedule/detail/794). His session on views last year was just amazing.

Hopefully there'll be plenty of time to sit down for meals and chats with all the people I correspond with throughout the year, but rarely get to see or talk to!

<sup>1</sup>And no, I don't get any kickback for saying nice things about the conference. Even reviewing all those proposals was a volunteer job. And Jay Pipes tricked me into it, the rat! He told me it would be only a few hours. Haha, you can't review 250 proposals in a few hours... I have to say though, some of them were really rewarding to read. One of them was about holding a cosmic prayer circle or something like that. Without expressing any opinion on my religion/spirituality, I did have to vote NO on that one -- sorry, wrong conference.
