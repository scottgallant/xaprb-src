I just thought I'd drop a line about [our book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596101716?tag=xaprb-20). Sales appear to be doing well still: the book is still at Amazon sales rank 3,213 and seems to hold pretty steady there. A lot of people have discovered it and are recommending it -- [including members of MySQL's professional services team](http://fallenpegasus.livejournal.com/758972.html). There are several positive reviews on Amazon (though if you like the book, a few more wouldn't hurt either). I've been hearing pretty much nothing but good things about it. So, all in all I am very happy about it.

I haven't actually seen any royalties, though. I assume it will be a long time before my advances are paid back. A friend of mine who's an author told me that after a few years he got his first royalty check, for a few bucks. I plan on spending mine all in one place.
