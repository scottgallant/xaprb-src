Here's a productivity tip that has saved me countless work while typing. Swap your Caps-lock and Escape keys. If you're like most people, you use Caps-lock virtually never, and Escape quite a lot. Especially if you're a programmer who happens to use [the best text editor, Vim](http://www.vim.org/). Read on to learn how to do this.

An easy way to do it on Ubuntu with Gnome: step one, create a .xmodmaprc file. You can run the following command to create the file and put the correct contents into it:

<pre>echo &gt; ~/.xmodmaprc '! Swap caps lock and escape
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
keysym Escape = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
add Lock = Caps_Lock'</pre>

Step two is to make this run every time you log in. Open up System-Preferences-Settings. Click the Add button to add a new entry to the additional startup programs list. In the "name" box, enter "xmodmap" or something else descriptive. In the Command box, enter "/usr/bin/xmodmap /home/[user]/.xmodmaprc", where [user] is your username.

And now get used to being able to hit Escape without reaching for it. If you like this, you might also be interested in using the [Dvorak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard) keyboard -- I can type on either Dvorak or QWERTY, but Dvorak has saved me from something approaching total paralysis of the hands, so it's worth checking into also.
