I've been following the [Drizzle](https://launchpad.net/drizzle) project with some interest. There's a lot to like about it. But you know what I like most about the project?

No dual licensing. Just plain GPL, version 2.

I personally think this is the foundation for why people are empowered, why there is excitement, why there is progress, why people are contributing.

I asked Brian Aker where the name Drizzle came from. It comes from Clouds, because Cloud Computing is all the rage these days (I kinda avoid the term, myself). And because he lives in Seattle. I'm sure you see the connections.

But my strongest association with Drizzle is with the words of one of [the greatest songwriters of all time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creedence_Clearwater_Revival):

> Five-year plans and New Deals  
> Wrapped in golden chains  
> And I wonder, still I wonder, who'll stop the rain?

What's MySQL's five-year plan? Didn't they just have a New Deal with Sun? Doesn't dual-licensing wrap the MySQL server in golden chains?

Are there too many coincidences here to just be coincidence, or is it that I'm short on sleep?

Will Drizzle really stop the rain?

CCR has another song about rain and Sun, but I'll stop at that. It's getting spooky in here. It makes me feel like they were having premonitions.
