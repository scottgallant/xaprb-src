This release contains minor bug fixes and new features. Besides the little bug fixes, there's a fun new feature in mk-heartbeat: it can auto-discover slaves recursively, and show the replication delay on all of them, to wit:

<pre>baron@keywest ~ $ mk-heartbeat --check --host master -D rkdb --recurse 10
master 0
slave1 1
slave2 1
slave3 4</pre>

(Not actual results. Your mileage may vary. Closed course, professional driver. Do not attempt).

Nothing else in this release is very exciting. I just wanted to get the bug fixes out there.
