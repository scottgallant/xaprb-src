I wanted to make readers who are web designers aware of a new resource for learning about raw performance (page load time and render time). This is the [Web Scaling Blog](http://www.webscalingblog.com/), a blog my employer started a while ago and didn't really update, but which is now starting to get some in-depth content thanks to a very smart colleague of mine, Nail Kashapov. There are a lot of practical, real-world examples of how you can dig deep into front-end performance and make your site really load fast. This is all in the interaction between the server and the browser -- no backend database stuff at all.

Essentially it's the same kind of things [Steve Souders](http://stevesouders.com/) talks about in his (excellent) book [High Performance Websites](http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Web-Sites-Essential/dp/0596529309?tag=xaprb-20). Actually, if you'll let me slip a little promotion in here, Steve himself has said some nice things about Nail's work, which is front-end optimization (his background is as a web developer for many years -- just like mine).

The beauty of front-end optimization is that it can *dramatically* improve user experience by making your site many times faster, and it generally doesn't require esoteric knowledge. Of course, there are things that an expert can find that a layman can't, but by and large you *can* teach yourself this stuff.

I am aware that this post might be seen as an advert, but I really don't mean it that way -- just want to share the frontend performance content with more people!
