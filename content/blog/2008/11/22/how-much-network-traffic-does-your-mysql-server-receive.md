This is a quick informal poll. I'd like to know how much network traffic your server receives (not sends), in bytes per second. Give both avg and max if you have them. I'm especially interested in hearing about big, heavily loaded systems.

I'll start things off: just by looking at a couple of customer systems, I see one customer's server is at 56k and 79k per second. Another slightly larger one is pulling 76k average and 200k max. A third who pushes the systems really hard is doing 1020k/second average and 1408k/sec max.

What about you? Get your friends at big enterprises to say how much traffic they get, too. Let's get a broad look at how much traffic comes into big workhorse MySQL servers.
