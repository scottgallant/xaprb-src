I just uploaded the 1.0.0 release of my [MySQL templates for Cacti](http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/). Now there's an actual download under the Downloads tab. I solved a number of issues in this release. The changelog:

> [VividCortex](https://vividcortex.com/) is the startup I founded in 2012. It's the easiest way to monitor what
> your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers [MySQL performance
> monitoring](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/mysql/) and [PostgreSQL
> performance management](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/postgres/) among many
> other features.
