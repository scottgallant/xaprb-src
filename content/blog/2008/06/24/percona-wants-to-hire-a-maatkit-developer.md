[Percona is looking to hire someone](http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2008/06/24/percona-is-looking-for-a-perl-and-python-expert/) to develop [Maatkit](http://www.maatkit.org/), among other things.

If I weren't having so much fun being the consulting team lead, I'd be doing it myself. (In fact, I'm still hacking on it a lot. Got some pretty fun stuff done this weekend.) I don't know what the rest of the world thinks, but I think Maatkit is a damn enjoyable project to work on. Hopefully someone else will have the same kind of mindset and want to get paid for it, unlike poor working-on-the-weekends me.

I'm not stepping away from the project. It's just grown a lot, and there is room and money to grow it much more. This is actually the best compliment to the project: that it is worth hiring someone to keep improving it. Lots of people are using it, and there's a lot of stealth-mode stuff I/we want to do with it too.

On a related note, who wants me to order another batch of Maatkit t-shirts? I've gotten quite a few questions about it.
