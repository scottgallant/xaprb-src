Oracle has released another [huge batch of improvements](http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/mysql-5.6-replication.html) to MySQL slated for MySQL 5.6. The pace of innovation in MySQL is accelerating rapidly and the improvements are impressive. I have not read all of the blog posts thoroughly yet, but I've skimmed and it looks fantastic.

The link posted above is ONE of the sets of improvements: there are also a bunch of other posts about new improvements to the query optimizer, InnoDB, and probably more. But I don't see a single table-of-contents blog post for those that I can link to. Hence I recommend that you look at [Planet MySQL](http://planet.mysql.com/) to find these posts.
