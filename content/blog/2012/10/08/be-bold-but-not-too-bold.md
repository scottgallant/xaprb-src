Someone's testing my blog recently, trying by hand to get comments through my spam blockers. They're trying by hand because automated attempts are blocked and the server simply doesn't respond. Hand-submitting spam doesn't scale, so only a few have popped up on my admin screen.

Have fun, I.P. addresses 173.213.212.234 and 219.91.208.244 (remember the Internet isn't anonymous). If you look around this blog you won't notice any spam comments. There's a reason for that -- a combination of reasons, actually. You're unlikely to defeat the measures I've put in place, unless you try things that most people would consider hacking. And if you do that, be prepared for the consequences.

Of course, if you're actually trying to leave a comment, just do it. All appropriate comments are approved, although sometimes it takes me a few hours to moderate them.
