Join me Wednesday for a free webinar on using the new [Percona Toolkit v2.0.3 to verify replication integrity](http://www.percona.com/webinars/2012-01-18-verifying-replication-integrity-with-percona-toolkit/). If you're not familiar with this topic, it's one of those must-do things that no one officially tells you is necessary with MySQL. The new tools in Percona Toolkit 2.0.3 make it much easier and less complicated -- and safer -- than before. Well worth an hour of your time.
