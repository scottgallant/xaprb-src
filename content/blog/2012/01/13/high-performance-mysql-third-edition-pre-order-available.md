You can pre-order the new edition of High Performance MySQL now on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-MySQL-Optimization-Replication/dp/1449314287/?tag=xaprb-20) or via [O'Reilly's website](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022343.do).

Eric Bergen called the second edition "[the best MySQL book on the planet](http://ebergen.net/wordpress/2010/07/20/how-to-be-a-mysql-dba-and-the-best-mysql-book-on-the-planet/)". What will the third edition be called? The best in the solar system? This reminds me of a joke, supposed to be a true story: three pizza restaurants next to each other had signs saying "best pizza in town," "best pizza in the world," and "best pizza on this block."
