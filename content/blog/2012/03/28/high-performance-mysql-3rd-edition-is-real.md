O'Reilly authors get 10 copies of their own books for free, and my copies of the third edition of High Performance MySQL arrived yesterday. Now it's official! It feels nice to actually hold it in my hand.

A few people have asked me about messages from Amazon saying that their ship date has changed. I don't know anything about that; maybe Amazon just made a wild guess the first time and now they actually know something more realistic. Or maybe [the book](http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-MySQL-Optimization-Replication/dp/1449314287/?tag=xaprb-20) is more popular than expected? It's currently at position #10 in the SQL category on Amazon, which seems pretty good to me. No "DaVinci Code" to be sure, but not bad for a technical book.
