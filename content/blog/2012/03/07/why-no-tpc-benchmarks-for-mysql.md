Someone asked me yesterday why there are no TPC benchmarks for MySQL. By "benchmarks" I don't mean "benchmark tools" but rather "official benchmark results." For example, see the [current TPC-C benchmarks](http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/results/tpcc_results.asp). Any true TPC benchmark has to be certified by the TPC and is an arduous and expensive process. Is it time for MySQL to play in this theater? Or does it simply not matter?
