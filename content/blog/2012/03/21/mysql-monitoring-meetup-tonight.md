Here's your spammy day-of reminder about tonight's free MySQL meetup. The topic is [MySQL Monitoring Bonanza](http://www.meetup.com/Central-Virginia-MySQL-Meetup/events/53029362/). There will be beer, pizza, pretty charts and graphs, and friends. Free as in beer (and pizza, did I mention that?)!

> Note: [VividCortex](https://vividcortex.com/) is the startup I founded in 2012. It's the easiest way to monitor what
> your servers are doing in production. VividCortex offers [MySQL performance
> monitoring](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/mysql/) and [PostgreSQL
> performance management](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/postgres/) among many
> other features.
