I'll speak at the [Shenandoah Ruby Users Group](http://www.meetup.com/ruby-128/events/55034362/) meeting next week in Harrisonburg, Virgina. I'm preparing a brand-new talk for this, called "Seven Things To Know About MySQL Performance." Hopefully my copies of the new [High Performance MySQL, 3rd Edition](http://www.highperfmysql.com/) will have arrived by then and I can give one away!

The meetup is free and friendly. If you're in the area, you oughta be there!
