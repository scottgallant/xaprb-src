My earlier blog post was wrong, our block of rooms for the [conference](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/) is still available past the 12th of March. However, there are apparently zero rooms available in the Hyatt other than our reserved block, and our block discount will expire soon (I'm a little hazy on the exact details, because I thought it was the 12th). What I have been told in no uncertain terms is this: "**If you know anyone who plans to attend the conference and needs a hotel room, they should book IMMEDIATELY in our room block or they will not be able to get a room in the Hyatt either at a reasonable rate or at all.**"

Please don't ask me to help -- I'm not involved in this, just trying to get the information out there. The logistics are beyond my ken.

Update: apparently the room discount rate ends on the 19th when our reservation on the block of rooms is released or something -- again, beyond my understanding. I am a Bear of Very Small Brain...
