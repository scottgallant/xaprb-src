I'll speak at the [Central Virginia Ruby Enthusiasts](http://www.meetup.com/804RVA/events/85518862/) group on Nov 13th. The topic is adaptive fault detection in MySQL servers. The techniques apply to any system for which you can measure throughput and concurrency, so come on out and learn how you can get rid of threshold-based monitoring!
