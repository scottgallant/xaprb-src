And now, a status update: I'm currently proofing the QC2 (quality control #2) revision of the book; after this, the book goes to manufacturing. The PDF is now 820 pages, which is a lot of work to proofread. You can imagine how much more in-depth we've been able to go with so many more pages.

The [free sample](http://www.highperfmysql.com/sample-chapter/) online is Chapter 8, on optimizing MySQL configuration. Liz van Dijk just [tweeted](https://twitter.com/#!/lizztheblizz/status/169805049403424768) this about it:

> The sample chapter of High Perf MySQL 3rd Ed is both amazingly to the point and hilarious at times. Instant buy for me.

If you haven't yet, I encourage you to take a look at the sample. Then go register for the conference to get your free copy, and I'll see you in Santa Clara! We're also arranging a book-signing at the conference, so you can get some scribbles on your copy if you want!
