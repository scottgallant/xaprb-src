When I kill a query or connection, whoever is running it gets a boring message about what happens. Wouldn't it be fun and useful to be able to specify the error message the user should see? Imagine the possibilities:

<pre>
mysql> KILL 10282, "Sorry, no cigar today. Try again tomorrow."
</pre>

Joking aside, relevant error messages would be great for all involved.
