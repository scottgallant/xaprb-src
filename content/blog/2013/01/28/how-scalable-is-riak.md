I'm reading a little bit about Riak, and was curious about performance and scalability. The only benchmark I found that allowed me to assess scalability was [this one from Joyent](http://joyent.com/blog/riak-smartmachine-benchmark-the-technical-details/). Of course, they say scalability is linear (everyone says that without knowing what it means) but the results are clearly not a straight line. So how scalable is it, really?

The Universal Scalability Law is *such* a powerful tool for thinking about scalability. A few seconds later, I had my answer.

Of course, this is to be taken with a spoonful of salt, because the modeling is based on only four measurements. But it's an incredibly quick way to get an idea of what we're looking at, just as a level-set.
