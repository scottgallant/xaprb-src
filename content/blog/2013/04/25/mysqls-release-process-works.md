Years ago I complained bitterly about [MySQL's backwards development and release model](/blog/2007/08/12/what-would-make-me-buy-mysql-enterprise/ "What would make me buy MySQL Enterprise?"), which made guinea pigs out of the paying customers. I think I'd be remiss if I didn't say [it's been fixed for years](http://insidemysql.com/the-milestone-release-model-revisited/). And it's really fixed right in my opinion -- much better than what I proposed.

Congratulations, and thanks, to the MySQL team for superhuman software engineering, release engineering, documentation, bug triage and analysis, and doing a million things right -- in other words, making a damn good database, which is *hard*. You know I still have gripes occasionally, and so do most people, but in the scheme of things -- wow. MySQL is awesome.
