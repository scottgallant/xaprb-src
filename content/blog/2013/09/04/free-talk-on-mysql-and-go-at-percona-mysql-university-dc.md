If you're in the Washington, DC area on Sept 12th, be sure to attend [Percona University](http://www.percona.com/news-and-events/percona-university/washington-dc). This is a free 1-day mini-conference to bring developers and system architects up to speed on the latest MySQL products, services and technologies. Some of the topics being covered include Continuent Tungsten; Percona XtraDB Cluster; MySQL Backups in the Real World; MariaDB 10.0; MySQL 5.6 and Percona Server 5.6; Apache Hadoop. 

I'll be speaking about using MySQL with Go. I'll talk about idiomatic database/sql code, available drivers for MySQL, and tips and tricks that will save you time and frustration. 

Continuent is sponsoring a complimentary breakfast and Percona will also provide refreshments throughout the day, along with a raffle for a chance to win cool t-shirts, copies of "High Performance MySQL," and a few other great prizes. 

It's free but space is limited, so [register](http://www.percona.com/news-and-events/percona-university/washington-dc)!
