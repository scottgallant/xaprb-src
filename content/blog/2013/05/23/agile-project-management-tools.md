Wow, talk about an industry that's overcrowded with look-alike me-too products. Online agile project management tools are a dime a dozen, which makes me think that they are probably all very similar and probably don't solve most people's needs. I've observed that when this is true, nearly-indistinguishable tools get reinvented, until the burden of evaluating the options is greater than the burden of just building yet another one, thus perpetuating the cycle.

Here are *some* of the products I looked at yesterday:

Acunote, ActiveCollab, AgileBench, AgileZen, Asana, Backlog, Basecamp, Blimp, Bugly, Huboard, IceScrum, JIRA, Kanbanery, Kickoff, Lean-To, Lighthouse, OnTime, PivotalTracker, Planbox, Plan.io, Rally, Redmine, ScrumDo, Sensei, SnowyEvening, Sprintly, TargetProcess, Trac, Trajectory, Trello, Unfuddle, YouTrack, Zoho Projects.
