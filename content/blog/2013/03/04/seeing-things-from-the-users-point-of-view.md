I was discussing how to avoid surprising users and someone pointed out that what seems intuitive and rational to one person is often complete insanity for others. The mental gap between a developer and a user can often be a chasm far too wide to cross. Of all the bug reports I've filed against MySQL, [here](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=44833) is my all-time favorite:

> `select * from t where a >= 1.0order by a;`
> 
> Does not cause an error. I believe it should, because there should be a whitespace before ORDER BY.

Similar syntax errors such as "`select 1e0from dual`" were also accepted as valid SQL. Much soul-searching later, the official reply from MySQL's development team:

> The server behaves properly here:  
> - "1&#8243; alone can not be an identifier, because it's followed by a "."  
> - therefore, the lexer parses "1&#8243; as the beginning of a number, and ends up with "1.0&#8243; as one token.  
> The next token will be "order", a keyword.
> 
> There is nothing special to document here either. What was reported is not a bug in the server, and is not a documentation bug.

What just happened here? It's fairly simple. Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by tunnel vision. The developer decided that the SQL isn't a syntax error because the lexer is designed to parse it. If the developer were able to stand in a user's shoes for a moment, this answer would be obviously absurd. But when you live deep in the dungeons of a large codebase, you lose the ability (despite your best intentions) to see a normal user's point of view.

For this reason I often doubt my own judgment. I'm ignorant of my ignorance. It's a very "meta" problem. I have to rely on others to give me a sanity check. 

I suggest, as a topic of discussion, that the willingness and ability to accept others' judgment over one's own is an essential characteristic of good leadership. I also suggest that knowing when this is appropriate is another attribute a good leader must have. Both of these are very difficult in my experience.
