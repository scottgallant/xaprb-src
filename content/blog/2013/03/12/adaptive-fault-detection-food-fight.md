I was a guest on the [Food Fight Show](http://foodfightshow.org/2013/03/adaptive-fault-detection.html) last week, along with a bevy of really smart people asking and answering tough questions on fault detection. We didn't talk a lot about MySQL, but given that [VividCortex](https://vividcortex.com/) is focusing on MySQL initially, pretty much all of my experience with zero-threshold, zero-configuration fault detection is MySQL-based.

It's a fun conversation with a lot of insights into the industry, what's wrong with current monitoring tools, and where monitoring is going. Also, it's sold out now, but [Monitorama](http://monitorama.com/) is a conference you might be interested in if you're doing monitoring (and who isn't?)
