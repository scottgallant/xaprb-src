I wish I could be at this: [Percona Live San Francisco](http://www.percona.com/events/percona-live-san-francisco-2011/). It is on February 16th. Cost is minimal, and content is maximal. The topic is on what's new in MySQL these days beyond 5.1: the new 5.5 release, HandlerSocket, MariaDB, and of course Percona Server.

This is a follow-up to the enormously successful Percona Performance Conference in 2009.
