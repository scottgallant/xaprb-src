I've released version 1.1.8 of the [Better Cacti Templates](http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/) project. This release includes a bunch of bug fixes and several important new graphs. There are [graphs](http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/wiki/MySQLTemplates#MySQL_Query_Response_Time_%28Microseconds%29) for the new [response-time statistics exposed in Percona Server](http://www.percona.com/docs/wiki/percona-server:features:response_time_distribution), and a new set of graphs for [MongoDB](http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/wiki/MongoDBTemplates).

> [VividCortex](https://vividcortex.com/) is the startup I founded in 2012. It's the easiest way to monitor what
> your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers [MySQL performance
> monitoring](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/mysql/) and [PostgreSQL
> performance management](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/postgres/) among many
> other features.

There are [upgrade instructions](http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/wiki/UpgradingTemplates) on the project wiki for this and all releases. There is also a comprehensive tutorial on [how to create your own graphs and templates](http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/wiki/CreatingGraphs) with this project. Use the [project issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/issues/list) (**not the comments on this post!**) to view and report issues, and use the [project mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/better-cacti-templates) to discuss the templates and scripts.

The full changelog follows.
