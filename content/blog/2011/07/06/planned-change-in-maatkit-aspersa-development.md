I've just sent [an email to the Maatkit discussion list](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/maatkit-discuss/JWW6QEbDoj8/discussion) to announce a planned change to how Maatkit (and Aspersa) are developed. In short, Percona plans to create a Percona Toolkit of MySQL-related utilities, as a fork of Maatkit and Aspersa. I'm very happy about this change, and I welcome your responses to that thread on the discussion list.
