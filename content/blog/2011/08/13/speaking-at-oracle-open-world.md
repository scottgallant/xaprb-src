I'll be presenting at [Oracle Open World](http://www.oracle.com/openworld/index.html) on the causes of downtime in MySQL, and how to prevent it. This is a research-based session that presents an easy-to-digest post-mortem of hundreds of emergency issues filed by Percona customers. The real causes and types of downtime surprised me quite a bit, and the preventions run counter to a lot of conventional wisdom. I'll just give a preview by saying that you should consider it a top priority to monitor how full your disks are! On the other hand, despite the fact that every monitoring tool in existence shows the binary log cache hit rate, not a single emergency in Percona history has ever been attributed to that.

The agenda at OOW is mind-bogglingly huge ([see Dave Stokes's blog post](http://opensourcedba.wordpress.com/2011/08/11/oracle-open-world-mysql-sessions/ "see Dave Stokes's blog post"), so here are the full official details of my session:

*   Session ID: 09304
*   Session Title: What Causes Downtime in MySQL, and How Can You Prevent It?
*   Venue / Room: Marriott Marquis &#8211; Golden Gate C2
*   Date and Time: 10/6/11, 9:00
