I'll be presenting a free one-hour webinar on preventing downtime in production MySQL servers, in conjunction with the ODTUG. It is scheduled on Thursday, November 10, 2011 3:00 PM &#8211; 4:00 PM EST, and you can [register for free](https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/229757198).

Here's an abstract of what you'll learn:

Everyone wants to prevent database downtime by being proactive, but how effective are the common measures such as inspecting logs and analyzing SQL? To be truly proactive, one must prevent problems, which requires studying and understanding the reasons for downtime. We have analyzed a selection of emergency issues that we have solved, to better understand what types of problems really occur in production environments. The results are somewhat surprising, and will be detailed in this talk. Most incidents we found were not MySQL-specific and will be familiar to Oracle DBAs as well as MySQL DBAs. This presentation will be valuable for the new or seasoned DBA, as well as to operational managers/directors and CTOs responsible for business critical implementations.

Please [register today](https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/229757198) and I look forward to joining you.
