This year's [Surge](http://omniti.com/surge/2011/) conference was a great sophomore event to follow up last year's inaugural conference. A lot of very smart people were there, and the hallway track was great.

I presented on three things: a lightning talk about causes of MySQL downtime; I chaired a panel on Big Data and the Cloud; and I showed how to derive scalability and performance metrics from TCP traffic. I've sent my slides to the Surge organizers, and I understand that they will be posting them as well as integrating them into the video of my session. In the meanwhile you can download my slides from [Percona's presentations page](http://www.percona.com/about-us/presentations/).
