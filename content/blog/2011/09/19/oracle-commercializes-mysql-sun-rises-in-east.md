I've never objected to someone making money from MySQL. I've only expressed disappointment that they [weren't doing it effectively enough](/blog/2007/08/12/what-would-make-me-buy-mysql-enterprise/). As I have predicted many times, Oracle is good at this. Oracle is the number one reason I didn't start a new career in some other database a few years ago. Oracle is making MySQL more successful not only for Oracle, but also for the users, the community, and the competition.

I am glad that Oracle is offering more [pay-only extensions](http://blogs.oracle.com/MySQL/entry/new_commercial_extensions_for_mysql) to the server in a way that creates opportunities for others to do the same, and I look forward to even more of them in the future.
