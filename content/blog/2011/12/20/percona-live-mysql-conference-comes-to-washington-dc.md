If you are using or considering MySQL, and you're in the Washington DC area, there's an excellent MySQL conference coming up on January 11th. I know because I am helping organize it.

The event is [Percona Live](http://www.percona.com/live/dc-2012/). It's the latest installment in our series of regional events, which have been very well received in New York, London, and San Francisco. Take a look at the [schedule](http://www.percona.com/live/dc-2012/schedule/) of talks -- this will be a very solid day of learning and networking.
