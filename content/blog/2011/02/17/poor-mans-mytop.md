I often need to watch a server that's very minimally configured, e.g. has no Perl DBI libraries installed, and I shouldn't install anything. The following snippet is a quick way to do that:

<pre>watch 'mysqladmin proc | grep -v Sleep | cut -b0-130'</pre>

Replace **130** by the width of your terminal, naturally.

(Of course, [innotop](http://code.google.com/p/innotop/) is much more featureful than mytop, but mytop is the essential functionality we're going for here!)
