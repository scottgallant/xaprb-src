The call for papers for the [MySQL conference's Ignite sessions](https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/tangent.org/viewform?hl=en&#038;ndplr=1&#038;formkey=dFdSRHlnM0pYRnRRTjNOSU1mSG93dlE6MQ#gid=0) is open. These are a lot of fun: 5 minutes, 20 slides, period. Last year I spoke way too fast -- if I do it again this year, I'll try not to cram so much into so little time. Either that, or I'll deliberately talk like Busta Rhymes.
