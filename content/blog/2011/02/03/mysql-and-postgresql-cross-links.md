A couple of extremely informative recent blog posts have gone to either Planet MySQL or Planet PostgreSQL, but not both, and I think everyone on both aggregators who cares about database internals should be interested in them. Here they are:

*   [Robert Haas: MySQL vs. PostgreSQL, Part 2: VACUUM vs. Purge ](http://rhaas.blogspot.com/2011/02/mysql-vs-postgresql-part-2-vacuum-vs.html)
*   [Ewen Fortune: How InnoDB handles REDO logging](http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2011/02/03/how-innodb-handles-redo-logging/)

Happy cross-pollination.
