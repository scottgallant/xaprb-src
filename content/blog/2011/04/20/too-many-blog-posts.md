I am ridiculously far behind on reading blog posts since the MySQL conference. I like to lag somewhat behind, because then when I read the posts I get to see some comments. But I'm much farther behind now than I want to be. This is mostly the fault of the MySQL replication, Performance Schema, NDB Cluster, and InnoDB developers, who just announced a large number of improvements in the upcoming MySQL 5.6 release. How long did it take them to draft all those posts? I hope they keep blogging steadily between releases, too. In the meantime, I'm too far behind. It's a good problem to have.
