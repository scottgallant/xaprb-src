I wish I could be at the [Hotsos Symposium](http://www.hotsos.com/sym11.html). I would keep my mouth very tightly closed and my ears wide open, and try to learn from people who are completely out of my league about [performance analysis topics I won't grok for another decade](http://perfdynamics.blogspot.com/2011/03/hotsos-2011-mine-gapp.html) (if I'm lucky). But I just can't cram in that much travel.

If you're like me, why don't you go to the [O'Reilly MySQL Conference](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/) instead? I'll be trying my feeble best to bring some of the Oracle performance scientist's mentality to this event, with presentations such as my [Forecasting MySQL Performance and Scalability](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/public/schedule/detail/17153) session. And a lot of smart people will be there from many database communities. [Percona has a 20% discount](http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2011/02/24/friends-of-percona-get-20-off-at-the-mysql-conference/), too -- not a bad enticement.
