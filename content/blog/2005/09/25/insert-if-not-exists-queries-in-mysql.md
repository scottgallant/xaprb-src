If necessary, INSERT IF NOT EXISTS queries can be written in a single atomic statement, eliminating the need for a transaction, and without violating standards. In this article I'll explain several ways to write such queries in a platform-independent way.

### Motivation

Suppose a table of urls has a unique index on the url:

<pre>create table urls(url varchar(200) primary key);</pre>

Now suppose I want to insert a row in a single statement, without using a transaction, and I only want the row to get inserted if the url isn't already in the table. I don't want any warnings or errors. I just want to issue a normal `INSERT` statement and know the url is now in the table.

Standard SQL provides no means of doing this. There's no syntax like this:

<pre>insert if not exists into url(url) values(...)</pre>

In Microsoft SQL Server, I can use an `IF` statement:

<pre>if not exists (select * from url where url = ...)
   insert into url...</pre>

This has to be wrapped in a transaction to avoid a race condition, though. Otherwise someone might insert a row between the time I check the table and when I insert the row. I want to do this in a single statement, without a transaction.

### Several solutions

One solution is to use a [mutex table](/blog/2005/09/22/mutex-tables-in-sql/):

<pre>insert into urls(url)
select '/blog/'
from mutex
    left outer join urls
        on urls.url = '/blog/'
where mutex.i = 1 and urls.url is null;</pre>

There are more flexible variations on this technique. Suppose there is no unique index on the url column. If desired, it is possible to insert several values in a single statement by changing the `WHERE` clause:

<pre>insert into urls(url)
select '/blog/'
from mutex
    left outer join urls
        on urls.url = '/blog/'
where mutex.i &lt; 5 and urls.url is null;</pre>

Now suppose the requirements specify up to three duplicate entries in the table, and each insert should add a single row. It is possible to insert a row at a time while enforcing the requirement with the following query:

<pre>insert into urls(url)
select '/blog/'
from mutex
    left outer join urls
        on urls.url = '/blog/'
where mutex.i = 1
group by urls.url
having count(*) &lt; 3;</pre>

This query shows the input to the `INSERT` statement:

<pre>select '/blog/', count(*)
from mutex
    left outer join urls
        on urls.url = '/blog/'
where mutex.i = 1
group by urls.url;</pre>
