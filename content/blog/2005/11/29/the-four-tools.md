I rarely blog on other people's content, but I can't agree more strongly with this [list of essential tools for software engineering](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/07/10/what_to_do_when_youre_screwed.html):

> There are an endless pile of tools engineers are fond of using in their development process, but there are only four that they really need:
> 
> *   Editor
> *   Compiler
> *   Version control
> *   Bug tracking

The first two tools are for the individual, and the second two are team tools, at least in most cases. Which tools are used, and how well they work, depends on many factors; in a professional environment, it's largely a corporate culture issue.
