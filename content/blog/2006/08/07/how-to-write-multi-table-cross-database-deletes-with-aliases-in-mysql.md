In an earlier article I explored the finer points of [multi-table, cross-database deletes in MySQL](/blog/2006/05/12/why-multi-table-cross-database-deletes-fail-in-mysql/), but I didn't get it quite right. This article explains the subtleties I've discovered since then. This is more complex than the MySQL manual documents.

Now I find it *is* possible to alias the tables, with certain restrictions. Apparently the way you name the target of the `DELETE`, and the way you first declare the aliases in the `FROM` clause, must match exactly. Then it's possible to do these deletes without fully qualifying the tables everywhere, and without having a current database selected.

For example, suppose you want to delete rows from `apples`, when they match in a join to `oranges`. The tables are in different databases. The following will not work:

<pre>delete apples
ERROR 1109 (42S02): Unknown table 'apples' in MULTI DELETE</pre>

The error is because `apples` is aliased to `a`. If you try to name `a` in the `DELETE` clause, a similar error happens. However, the following will work:

<pre>delete db1.apples as a</pre>

Now you've named the tables identically in both places, so it works. It's as though you have to re-alias the table in the `DELETE` clause. The optional `AS` keyword may be omitted in one or both places you declare an alias, so even this form will work:

<pre>delete db1.apples a</pre>

... but see my [SQL coding standards](/blog/2006/04/26/sql-coding-standards/) for why I always include the optional but should-be-mandatory `AS` keyword.

With these requirements met, you can use aliases in the rest of the (possibly complex) query, which is much nicer than writing out fully qualified names everywhere.
