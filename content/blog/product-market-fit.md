title: "Product/Market Fit"
---

Product/market fit is a familiar, comfortable phrase in my circles of acquaintances and businessfolk. But despite using it constantly, and learning about it from many people who know a lot about business and entrepreneurship, over the last few years it's taken on a new and deeper meaning for me. I wasn't able to understand this before, even when people tried hard to explain it to me.

The story really begins in late 2012, when I was pitching [VividCortex](https://www.vividcortex.com/) to potential investors. A lot of my early pitch revolved around my limited exposure to SaaS monitoring products, primarily New Relic. The idea for VividCortex, as obvious as it seems in hindsight, took years to dawn on me, and when it did, New Relic seemed to be the obvious parallel to everything I wanted to do. "VividCortex is like New Relic for the database," I began saying.

Product/Market Fit
* Not product/user
* Market includes buyer
* http://www.tomtunguz.com/are-you-spending-enough-time-gtm/?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=webfeeds
* Product includes sales team, etc
* MySQL and InfluxDB as examples; MariaDB http://mysqlblog.fivefarmers.com/2016/04/13/requests-for-mariadb/ 
* “If you build it they will come,” but are THEY the buyers who will sustain? You can build momentum with people who are there for the wrong reasons, and change will upset them.
* It is not obvious. Remember that venture capitalists who was convinced that he knew exactly what we needed to build? And there were many more like him.
* Adapting to the market/buyer will have technical consequences, so you can’t necessarily change your sales/GTM model quickly, nor can experiments always be cheap and quick
* The pitch meeting where the salesperson told us we would have to learn how to sell it - we thought we’d just build a great product and it would sell itself
* We also thought the New Relic model would work for us, but the deployment and installation is different and that matters a lot
* Also, roles we didn’t think would matter… we overvalued engineering. See “ https://twitter.com/j_houg/status/714572491709001728 LOLing at the ML companies looking for their first ds/ml hire. You should have thought about that before you distributed founder equity. and https://twitter.com/j_houg/status/714572576383602688 @j_houg If ML really is core to the business, well, you seem to have gotten things backwards. Good luck.” But sales and marketing and legal and finance and… should the VP sales have founder equity too?
* Zenoss built on a community that they abandoned 
* building billing prematurely. Funding via upfront deals and Tunguz
