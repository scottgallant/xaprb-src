title: Digg Reader and Feedly, Two Great Google Reader Alternatives
description: "Live without Google Reader is hard, but I'm hanging in there."
---

I used Google Reader since time out of mind, but of course by now you know it
was discontinued a while ago. I still live and breathe RSS feeds, and I really
don't pay much attention to social media, news sites, or the like of Hacker News
and Slashdot. I like the flexibility and unhurried pace of subscribing to
updates from specific individuals and companies.

At first, I didn't see a reader that offered the experience I was looking for: a
GMail-like user interface with feeds clustered together in categories, navigable
with keystrokes. Importantly, some subtle features such as marking an item
unread are a key part of my usage.

I tried [Feedly](https://feedly.com) first, but it had some bugs that drove me
away. Recall that this was a couple of years ago; this is not a criticism of
Feedly's state of development now. One of the most important ones was some kind
of strange browser interaction that caused items to be marked as read simply by
moving the mouse over the title.

One of my colleagues suggested [Digg Reader](http://digg.com/reader) at the
time. I think the RSS reader in Digg is probably one of its best kept secrets.
It was almost a direct copy of the Google Reader user interface's most basic and
important features.

I've been using Digg Reader since then, and am very happy with it. Nonetheless,
I recently took another look at Feedly, and at first glance, I'm even *happier*
with it than with Digg Reader. Both products support import and export of OPML,
so it's easy to migrate between them and I feel no particular switching cost or
loyalty. I'll go where there's the best UI and functionality.

What's better about Feedly than Digg Reader? Well, for my purposes, they both
have all the same solid feature set I was looking for, but Feedly has a slightly
nicer design in my opinion, and offers a couple little niceties. I'll get to
that in a moment.

Here's a screenshot of each:

What made me curious to investigate Feedly again after all this time? One of the
things that changed for me was using my [Barnes and Noble Nook
HD+](/blog/2015/01/19/install-cyanogenmod-nook-hdplus/). I use this tablet
regularly now, almost always at least once a day, and a key thing I do on it is
catch up on the latest feed updates.

Digg Reader and Feedly both have Android apps, and both work very similarly and
intuitively from my point of view. But there were a few small things
that didn't feel completely finished in Digg Reader. One of them is the 
lack of a way to mark an item as unread in Digg Reader.

I've just tried out the Feedly app, and I believe after using it for a bit that
it has a nicer design, too. It's a bit hard to pinpoint, as good design always
is, but instead of feeling like I'm reading through content from programmers who
don't use CSS, Feedly formats the content and arranges it in a way that makes it
feel like I'm reading a curated magazine. There are different layouts of the
"home" view, and they're easy to switch between too. I like all of them, to tell
the truth.

Although if I had one suggestion for the Feedly team, it would probably be...
imitate the Android GMail app's layout and UI!

Regardless, I might take a look at the benefits of paying Feedly. Last I looked
at Digg Reader, they were still not taking any payments. It's odd in some ways,
but I feel better about products I can pay for. If it's free, I feel unsure
it'll be there tomorrow.

Here are screenshots of both UIs on my Nook, followed by a landscape-mode one of
Feedly in magazine layout. In non-magazine layout, I actually prefer Digg
Reader's UI here:
