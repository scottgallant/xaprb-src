A number of people have commented to me over the last few years that when they
search for me on Google, it suggests that they might want to search for "Baron
Schwartz left Percona." This is a top suggestion when I search for myself, too.

Since people are searching for it, maybe I should explain it.

In 2012, more than
three years ago now, I left Percona to found
[VividCortex](https://vividcortex.com/). At the time I did not call attention to
it since I was not sure if there could be any negative consequences to Percona.
I didn't want to leave Percona, but I wanted to pursue my dream more than I
wanted to stay. I also wanted to change from a
[fully remote and globally distributed](/blog/2009/09/27/6-ways-to-stay-sane-while-working-from-home/) work style to
working in the same physical place as my colleagues.

There's really nothing more to it than that. Percona is a great company and I
have been impressed at their growth and success since I left.  I stay in touch
and do what I can to help them. I will always have fond memories of the nearly 5
years I spent there, and the utmost respect and loyalty to the great people who
shared that journey with me. Percona is a lot of what makes me who I am.
