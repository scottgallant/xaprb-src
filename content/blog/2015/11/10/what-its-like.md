title: "What it's Like"
---

At Velocity/OSCON 2015 in Amsterdam a couple of weeks ago, the conference
committee approached me to ask if I'd be up for doing an Ignite talk. It was
rather last-minute and I had only hours to prepare. I said yes and then tried to
think of a topic. I turned to Twitter and asked, if you could have me talk for 5
minutes on any topic, what would it be? A couple of people responded that they
wanted to know what founding a company was like, so I sat down in the speaker
lounge at the RAI and started trying to figure out what it's like to be a
founder/CEO.

You'd think I'd know after three years, but truthfully, it's still hard to
really know what I feel.

Anyway, I did it. I sent O'Reilly twenty slides of uncaptioned
[images](http://unsplash.com/) that moved through an arc, and tried to write a
story I could tell on stage. If you're not familiar with Ignite, it's a format
in which exactly twenty slides advance automatically after fifteen seconds each,
for a total of five minutes.

I had to wing it to some extent, and while speaking I thought one of the
slides might even have gotten lost in the void of the internet and I had to skip
some stuff I'd planned (it was really confusing to see what slide was on
screen), but I got through it. Below I'm sharing my notes---which I did not
exactly follow, because I changed things until the moment I spoke---and at the
end is a video of the talk.

If you're a founder/CEO or similar, and you'd like to talk about your struggles,
I'd encourage you to reach out to me or to peers. (I can't be available for
everyone, but if you're desperate you need to talk to someone.)

The working title of the talk was either "What it's like" or "Why I do this" or
something similar.

OK, enough preamble, let's do this.

### Why I Choose Technology

![ignite-00001.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00001.jpg)

Years ago my friend Eliane asked why I love databases, and it took me years to
answer. I always loved knowing how things work. I used to disassemble clocks and
put them back together. Eventually I realized that technology is how I express
my creativity. 

### Creative Expression

![ignite-00002.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00002.jpg)

Creativity is a vital part of being human. All forms of expression are equally
valid: dance, music, art, writing, athletics, coding. Whatever you love,
whatever brings you alive, is valid. That includes being a nerd.

### The Importance of Creativity

![ignite-00003.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00003.jpg)

Creativity is self actualization. It's how we express agency in the world. It's
how we say "I am alive and I choose to live, not just exist." I want this for
you, and for me, all of us.

### So I Founded A Company

![ignite-00004.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00004.jpg)

Three years ago I founded company to amplify my personal mission, to give to
others what I wanted for myself: a life of purpose and validation that being a
nerd is just as honorable as being a sculptor. I speak today because I want to
share this experience with others.

### What's It Like Being A Founder?

![ignite-00005.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00005.jpg)

In a word, stressful. Words to describe it don't really exist. It's a roller
coaster from fear to joy and back, sometimes every 20 minutes. I can describe
specific dimensions of the experience, but it's like becoming a parent. You have
to live it to know it.

### Demands From Everywhere

![ignite-00006.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00006.jpg)

Everyone wants something from me. Customers, employees, investors, community,
family, vendors, governments. The amount of time and energy left over for myself
is very small. Personal and company demands are often in conflict.

### No Comfort Zone

![ignite-00007.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00007.jpg)

My comfort zone is mostly off-limits now. I am a reserved person, but I must be
outgoing. I prefer to support people, now I must sometimes challenge them. I'm a
single-tasking focuser, now I have to multitask. I deny myself the pleasure of a
job well done.

### Compounding Effects

![ignite-00008.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00008.jpg)

It's hard to find time or motivation for exercise. I constantly forget things
and people. This becomes a self-reinforcing negative spiral quickly.

### Sleep Is Elusive

![ignite-00009.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00009.jpg)

Sometimes I wake and cannot deal with intrusive thoughts and a racing pulse. At
2 in the morning, jacked on adrenaline and fear, I'm not solving anything. When
I do sleep I have repetitive dreams of being late and unprepared.

### The Struggle

![ignite-00010.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00010.jpg)

Ben Horowitz's book The Hard Thing About Hard Things is the best description
of the experience I've read yet. to get a taste, read [The
Struggle](http://www.bhorowitz.com/the_struggle).

### Self-Reconstruction

![ignite-00011.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00011.jpg)

Being a founder and CEO forces me to constantly destroy the old person I used
to be. He is no longer what I need. He got me to this point, but now the task
is to systematically amputate the parts I do not want and grow new ones.

### Overwhelm

![ignite-00012.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00012.jpg)

This is way beyond "productivity tips" and "life hacking." It's self
transformation. This is what it means to be committed. The only way through it
is through it. It's often a brutal process.

### So Much To Lose

![ignite-00013.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00013.jpg)

It's hard to ask for help because there's so much to lose. Everyone is looking
for the slightest sign of weakness or fault. Honestly admitting a shortcoming
could mean not winning a customer or investor, losing an employee.

### Loneliness

![ignite-00014.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00014.jpg)

I'm not alone in the struggle, but I'm lonely. Most founders suffer in silence
and isolation. Depression, sickness, addiction, breakdowns and even suicide
are the result. It's rare for founders to break the silence. I'm doing it
today because we deserve it.

### Not Impostor Syndrome

![ignite-00015.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00015.jpg)

It's popular right now to talk about impostor syndrome, but this isn't impostor
syndrome. This is real and honest. This is a valid experience. I take comfort
knowing that my discomfort with this unnatural experience is an appropriate
response to the position I'm in. If you are feeling the same thing, know that
you're not damaged goods.

### Daily Rededication

![ignite-00016.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00016.jpg)

To cope and adapt, I have to make an effort to help myself and ask others to
help me. I begin each day by dedicating myself to the service of something
greater than myself. I resolve to be fully alive, present in the moment, and
to suppress my self-will. I read sacred literature. I journal. Then I go do my
best. I end the day by forgiving myself.

### Meditation

![ignite-00017.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00017.jpg)

Meditation is a huge part of what keeps me sane. Meditation does not still my
mind or stop the intrusive thoughts. It helps me notice and accept what is
happening to me, within me, and around me. I worked with an architect, an old
man with a lifelong transcendental meditation practice, for years. But I lost
it. I had to find a system that actually worked for me. The Headspace book and
app helps.

### Asking For Help

![ignite-00018.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00018.jpg)

I also ask for help. I've reached out to a lot of other founders and talked.
They may not know it but they've made a huge difference for me. I hope you
reach out to me if you need help, too. 

### Working as a Team

![ignite-00019.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00019.jpg)

I've also had to learn to stop trying to do everything myself. I have a team
of people who are better at their jobs than I am. I don't ask them to be my
confidantes, but they support me whether they know it or not. And I have
advisors, mentors, and a professional coach who make it easier day by day.

### Alternate Conclusion 1: You Make A Difference

![ignite-00020.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00020.jpg)

It sounds hard. Why do I do it? I do it because of you. You are here for a
purpose. You have impact. The world needs you and cannot replace you. You make
a difference. But really, I do it for you because doing it for you is doing it
for myself. I must be to the world what I want the world to be for me. I get
back more than I give. My lows are lower, but my highs are higher too. Thank
you. *[I wanted to end with a note of inspiration and encouragement, gesturing
towards each person's irreplaceable role in life, but I changed this ending at
the last moment.]*

### Alternate Conclusion 2: Why Do I Do It?

![ignite-00020.jpg](/media/2015/11/ignite-00020.jpg)

I believe that the product, company, and the team serve a greater good. It's
true that it's hard, but I believe I must be what I want to see in the world.
My low times are worse, but my highs are higher. *[I chose this ending because I
thought the note of encouragement, although important and true, was not
consistent with the rest of the talk. The sentiment of the first alternative
ending still holds, though.]*
