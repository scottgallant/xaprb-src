title: Help Me Make This Blog More Accessible
---

Dear Reader,

Hi! I probably don't know you, but I'd like to make this blog better for you. If
you're disabled---for example, perhaps you use a screen reader, a special
device, or have other needs that I might not anticipate, I'd really love your
feedback on what I can do to make my content easier for you to read and enjoy.

A couple of things I've been thinking about recently:

- If you use a screen reader, does the navigation or other stuff get in the way?
- If you use some device to do something like, I dunno, convert my RSS feed to
  podcasts and listen in the subway, how well does that work?
- What should I do if I want to include a complicated equation? Use an image,
  use something like MathJax, mark it as skippable for screen readers?
- If I include images, does it matter what I name them? How good of an
  experience is the image I included above?
- What can I do to make links easier to use? Should I have meta tags like "next"
  and "previous" and so on? Should I always add link titles or something?

I'm going to link to a couple of recent articles and ask you what I could have
done better to make them easier for people-who-are-not-like-me. Here: [article
1](/blog/2015/11/12/universal-scalability-law-teach-mysql/), [article
  2](/blog/2015/11/10/what-its-like/).

Thanks.
