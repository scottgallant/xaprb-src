Now that I have [innotop](http://code.google.com/p/innotop) hosted on sourceforge, I'd like to use the tools they provide, especially the forums and mailing lists. I've set up an [innotop-discuss mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/innotop-discuss), which I hope you'll find a better way to get support than posting in the comments on this blog. I think I will close comments on all innotop-related articles I post, because I can't keep track of feedback in so many places.

Sourceforge also provides a bug tracker and other tools, which you are welcome to use. Do whatever seems right to you!

As a side note, my employer uses [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/), which I adore. It is *such* a nice system. It's wonderful to have bugs, wiki, mileposts and source control integrated. Sourceforge's tools are great, but they feel a little clumsy and slow compared to Trac.
