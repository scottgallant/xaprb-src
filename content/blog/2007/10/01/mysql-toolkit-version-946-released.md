This release of MySQL Toolkit adds a new tool, fixes some minor bugs, and adds new functionality to one of the helper scripts.

### New tool: MySQL Parallel Dump

I wrote an [introduction to MySQL Parallel Dump](/blog/2007/09/30/introducing-mysql-parallel-dump/) yesterday. It's a much smarter way to dump your data if you have a lot of it, and it's actually a very usable lightweight multi-threaded backup tool (it can do most dump-oriented backup jobs without a wrapper script, in my opinion).
