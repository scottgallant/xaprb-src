Work continues apace on [High Performance MySQL, Second Edition](/blog/2007/08/30/coming-soon-high-performance-mysql-second-edition/) (the link leads to the chapter outline). I'm working now on Chapter 6, Advanced SQL Functionality, and thought I'd solicit input on it. Are there things you'd like to see us cover? Do you have any favorite techniques you'd like to see us include? Feel free to leave feedback in the comments. The chapter is already significantly done, with 26 pages written, but the ink's not on paper yet, so there's still time to correct omissions!

I should note that there are separate chapters on architecture, schema and indexing design, application optimization, query optimization, etc. We're trying to focus this chapter on "advanced features" and how to get high performance out of them. Also, the outline is still subject to change: there's so much material that it's hard to decide the best place to put something, and exactly what is an "advanced feature" might be open to interpretation, or we might feel something is better placed elsewhere. That said, please throw your ideas at us and we'll worry about the details for you. Here's the outline of this chapter, as of three minutes ago:
