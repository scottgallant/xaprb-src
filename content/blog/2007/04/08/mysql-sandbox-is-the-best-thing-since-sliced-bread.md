I've been preparing for my [innotop session](http://www.mysqlconf.com/cs/mysqluc2007/view/e_sess/13213) at the [upcoming MySQL conference](http://www.mysqlconf.com/), and enlisted [Giuseppe Maxia's MySQL Sandbox](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-sandbox) to help me get a bunch of MySQL servers, from 3.23.58 to 5.2.3, running on one machine. It was super-easy and has helped me find some bugs in [innotop](http://code.google.com/p/innotop). I should have done this a long time ago.

To get started, I just read through Giuseppe's Sandbox article on O'Reilly Databases Blog. After reading this, I downloaded the scripts and a bunch of binary distributions of MySQL (I'm using Ubuntu). I took the "how to make it easy" advice and unpacked them all in /opt/mysql:

<pre>baron@wabbit:~ $ ls /opt/mysql
3.23.58  4.0.27  4.1.0  4.1.22  5.1.15  5.2.3</pre>

After that, all I had to do was change to the sandbox directory and say `./express_install.pl <version>` for each version, and it set everything up for me. Boy, was that easy! Before I did this, I had spent a couple hours reading through the manual's instructions on how to get many servers on one machine -- this was much faster and easier.

The next step for me was setting up some of the servers as slaves of others. I needed to modify the config files to set the server-id, and to make them listen to TCP connections, but that was trivial.

Then I pointed innotop at all of them and started finding bugs in innotop (and a few in MySQL's documentation too). Who knew [SHOW OPEN TABLES behaved so differently in 3.23.58](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=27706)? It was high time I did this; I actually feel a little silly for putting it off so long.
