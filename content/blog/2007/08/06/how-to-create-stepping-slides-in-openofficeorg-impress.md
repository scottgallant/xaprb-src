If you've used Microsoft Powerpoint to create "stepping" slides -- slides that appear one bullet point at a time -- and can't figure out how to do it with OpenOffice.org Impress, this article is for you.

### What are stepping slides?

"Stepping" slides are the only animation or transition effect I allow myself in slideshows.  I don't generally like animations or other distractions; when I give talks, I am always painfully conscious of how much the audience tends to focus on the slides.  I've seen some research that suggests people's brains turn off when they look at slides, so I try to minimize that by making as few slides as possible and engaging the audience.

But enough about me, what do you think about my shirt?

Seriously: stepping slides one bullet point at a time is helpful.  It lets me pack a lot more onto a slide, so I can build the story around a concept gradually, increasing the mental density of whatever's on screen.  If the whole slide pops up at once, it's a distraction.  If I split it into a bunch of slides, it's a distraction.

### How do you do it with OpenOffice.org Impress?

Don't search the Help files for "stepping" -- I went that route and crashed OpenOffice.org.  Strangely, at the moment the search function crashed, I was writing a presentation about search and indexing algorithms!

You have to do it as an animation.  One step at a time (no pun intended):

<ol>
<li>First, create a slideshow and add a bulleted list:
<a href='/media/2007/08/openofficeorg-stepping-1.png' title='OpenOffice.org Impress Stepping Slides, Part 1'><img src='/media/2007/08/openofficeorg-stepping-1.thumbnail.png' alt='OpenOffice.org Impress Stepping Slides, Part 1' /></a></li>
<li>Next, select the list text and choose the "Custom Animation" sub-pane in the right-hand side:
<a href='/media/2007/08/openofficeorg-stepping-2.png' title='OpenOffice.org Impress Stepping Slides, Part 2'><img src='/media/2007/08/openofficeorg-stepping-2.thumbnail.png' alt='OpenOffice.org Impress Stepping Slides, Part 2' /></a></li>
<li>Click the Add... button in the Custom Animation pane and select Appear, then OK to dismiss the dialog box:
<a href='/media/2007/08/openofficeorg-stepping-3.png' title='OpenOffice.org Impress Stepping Slides, Part 3'><img src='/media/2007/08/openofficeorg-stepping-3.thumbnail.png' alt='OpenOffice.org Impress Stepping Slides, Part 3' /></a></li>
<li>If your Custom Animation pane is large enough, you'll see a small preview of the bullet points at the bottom.  Notice there's a mouse-click icon next to the first one, and the "Start" pull-down menu is blank (no selection).  At this point, all the bullet points are going to be animated as a unit:
<a href='/media/2007/08/openofficeorg-stepping-4.png' title='OpenOffice.org Impress Stepping Slides, Part 4'><img src='/media/2007/08/openofficeorg-stepping-4.thumbnail.png' alt='OpenOffice.org Impress Stepping Slides, Part 4' /></a></li>
<li>The last step is to make the animation start upon clicking, and make that apply to each bullet point.  Pull down the "Start" drop-down and select "On click".  You should now see a little mouse-click icon next to each bullet point:
<a href='/media/2007/08/openofficeorg-stepping-5.png' title='OpenOffice.org Impress Stepping Slides, Part 5'><img src='/media/2007/08/openofficeorg-stepping-5.thumbnail.png' alt='OpenOffice.org Impress Stepping Slides, Part 5' /></a></li>
</ol>

You're done!  Test your slideshow just to be sure.
