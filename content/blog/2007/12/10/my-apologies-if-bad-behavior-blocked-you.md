To cut down on comment spam, I have [Bad Behavior](http://www.bad-behavior.ioerror.us/) enabled on this blog, and [there was a minor issue with the version I had, though in general it has been wonderful](http://www.bad-behavior.ioerror.us/2007/12/06/bad-behavior-2011/). My apologies if it blocked you. I didn't get any email from folks saying they were blocked, but it blocked me! Apparently a fairly common complaint. I've upgraded now and I'm not seeing any more issues.

There's a lot of hate mail towards Bad Behavior's author because of this, so I want to try to cancel some of that out: this plugin has saved me many gray hairs. Thanks.
