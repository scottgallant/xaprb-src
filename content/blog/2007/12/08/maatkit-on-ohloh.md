[Sheeri ](http://sheeri.net/)wrote a post (now a 404 error) referring to [Maatkit ](http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/)on [Ohloh](http://www.ohloh.net/), which I have never heard of before. I took a look at [what Ohloh thinks about Maatkit](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/10083). It's kind of neat. Beyond just the obvious "social website" stuff that's all the rage these days, it actually looks at the project's SVN history, analyzes the codebase, and so on.

It also estimates 8 person-years of work have gone into the project, and says that at $55,000/year it would cost $450,702 to write the code as it currently exists, which is kind of funny. It took me a whole lot less than 8 years to write. (Perhaps this is why that salary strikes me as unrealistic).

It has a couple of other interesting things, like a visual timeline of source control commits, analysis of licenses it finds in the code, analysis of programming languages, and so on. Really pretty neat overall.

There's also the ubiquitous popularity rating: how many people have "stacked" the project. I notice it's been stacked 3 times, coincidentally the same number as [MySQL Proxy](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/6252). It will be interesting to see how that changes over time.
