Hi! I hope you are finding this blog helpful and enjoyable.

A few words about me. I am Baron Schwartz, cofounder of [VividCortex](https://vividcortex.com) and the lead author of [High Performance MySQL](http://www.highperfmysql.com/), among other things. My online nickname Xaprb is my first name typed in QWERTY on a Dvorak keyboard layout.

In addition to my writing, I've created quite a bit of open-source software. I speak frequently at industry events, conferences focused on databases, open-source and DevOps, and inside major corporations such as Google. Please contact me if you would like me to address your organization.

You can contact me like this: `SELECT REVERSE( 'moc.brpax@norab');` Please do not ask me about advertising or guest posting on this blog, and please don't send me solicitations for service provider offerings, outsourcing, etc. I will mark your email as spam.

I also invite you to connect with me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/xaprb) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/xaprb).

Some of the links on my blog are "affiliate links." This means if you
click on the link and purchase the item, I will receive an affiliate
commission. I only recommend products or services I use personally and
believe will add value to my readers. I would recommend the products
without the commission, too.
